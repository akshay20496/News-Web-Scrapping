        "All three remaining Indians knocked out in Chennai Open qualifiers": "None of the remaining three Indians, including Rohan Bopanna, could make the main singles draw of the Aircel Chennai Open as all of them suffered defeats in the second round of the qualifying event, here today.It means that India’s representation in the men’s singles will be restricted to Somdev Devvarman and wild card entrants Yuki Bhambri and Vishnu Vardhan.Big serving Bopanna fought hard before losing 6—7(2) 6—7(2) to Japan’s Go Soeda while Mohit Mayur Jayaprakash lost his second round clash 3—6 2—6 to Canadian Vasek Pospisil.Talented left—hander Prajnesh Gunneswaran also fought valiantly before losing to experienced American campaigner Rajeev Ram 6—3, 7—6 (3).In a highly competitive affair, World No 120 Soeda broke Bopanna in the third game of the first set while Bopanna broke Soeda in the sixth game of the same set.The match went into a tie—breaker in both the sets with the players level with six games each.However, Bopanna could not make it count when it mattered and gave away both the tie—breakers tamely.Soeda will now meet Edouard Roger—Vasselin in the final qualifying round after the Frenchman beat Dusan Lajevic today.The next round will also see Yuchi Sugita (Japan) meet Rik De Voest (South Africa), Izak Van Der Merwe (South Africa) meet Dutch star Thiemo De Bakker and Pospisil meet Ram.Results: G Soeda (JPN) bt R Bopanna (IND) 7—6(2), 7—6(2); R De Voest (RSA) bt T Huey (PHI) 6—3, 6—4; T de Bakker (NED) bt J Cabal (COL) 6—1, 6—3; I Van der Merwe (RSA) bt I Cervantes—Huegun(ESP) 6—4, 7—5;E Roger—Vasselin (FRA) bt D Lajovic (SRB) 7—6(1), 6—2; V Pospisil (CAN) bt M Jayaprakash (IND) 6—3, 6—2; Y Sugita (JPN) bt J Sousa (POR) 6—4, 6—1; R Ram (USA) bt P Gunneswaran (IND) 6—3, 7—6(3).

        "Merkel calls on China ‘to use influence’ on Iran": "German Chancellor Angela Merkel has called on China to “make better use of its influence” on Iran to resolve a looming stand-off with the West over the country's nuclear programme.While Ms. Merkel has pressed China for more support for strong United Nations Security Council measures to deal with both Iran and Syria, she has also sought greater Chinese assistance for the debt-hit eurozone, facing a tough diplomatic balancing act on a three-day visit that began here on Thursday.“We believe in recent years discussion has not led to any significant advancement [on the Iranian nuclear issue],” she told an audience of scholars and journalists at the influential Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, where she began her visit on Thursday morning.“If we talk about European sanctions against Iran, the question is how China can make better use of its influence to make Iran understand that the world must not have another power with nuclear weapons,” she said, adding that she did not see “transparency” in Iran's nuclear programme.China has recently voiced opposition to further sanctions as well as to a ban on the import of Iranian oil backed by the U.S. and European Union. Iran is China's third biggest source of foreign oil.Ahead of her afternoon meeting with Premier Wen Jiabao, Ms. Merkel acknowledged there were persisting differences between China and the West. “China thinks further sanctions are wrong,” she said. “We may have a difference of opinion but it is important that dialogue continues.”Following talks, Mr. Wen reiterated in remarks to reporters China's opposition to sanctions, saying “dialogue and cooperation is the only correct and effective solution.. and sanctions will not fundamentally address the problem”.In Beijing, the German Chancellor has sought to reassure Chinese investors that the EU was taking measures to address its financial problems, from pushing reforms and encouraging innovation to reducing bureaucracy.Mr. Wen said China was considering “involving itself more deeply into” efforts to address the European debt issue through channels such as the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF) and the European Stability Mechanism (ESM), without specifying details.Chinese officials have expressed wariness over investing in government bonds in Europe, though Mr. Wen said China was “firmly confident” in the future of the European economy. Around a quarter of the $3.2-trillion foreign exchange reserves are in Euro-denominated assets, Reuters reported on Thursday.China's rising importance to Europe has been made clear in recent weeks, with firms showing an interest in acquiring assets in the debt-hit continent. Earlier this week, Sany Heavy Industry, one of China's biggest construction equipment firms, told the Shanghai Stock Exchange it would pay €360 million to acquire 90 per cent of Putzmeister, a German engineering firm.The China Investment Corporation, last month, also invested an estimated £1 billion to acquire an 8.68-per-cent stake in Thames Water, the largest water company in Britain.Ms. Merkel rejected suggestions that sensitive issues, such as human rights or even pressuring China to take a greater role in global affairs, would be downplayed as Germany and the rest of Europe looked for greater support amid economic strains.She said “no sensitive topics are off the agenda”, including human rights and the rule of law. “Dialogue on these topics creates trust,” she added.Ms. Merkel also made a strong call for greater access and more intellectual property rights protection for German firms in China.“The German market is fairly open,” she said. “So we hope German enterprises will face the same treatment that Chinese enterprises enjoy in China”.Last year, China became Germany's largest export market outside the EU, with bilateral trade reaching €140 billion last year, Ms. Merkel said."

        "India did not deserve to be in the finals": "World Cup winner India returned empty-handed from the Commonwealth Bank ODI triangular series here.Truth to tell, the side did not deserve to qualify for the finals. India finished with the lowest batting average — 28.01 — among the three teams in the league phase. And its bowling average of 38.94 was the highest.If India's triumphant campaign in the same competition down under in 2008 was vibrant, the side lacked inspiration this time around. And this team is extremely dependent on conditions.It's no coincidence that the best Indian batting displays in the tri-series came in Adelaide and Hobart where the pitches were batsman-friendly. In fact, the surface at Hobart's Bellerive Oval could have been straight out of the sub-continent.On pitches with some juice in them — at the 'Gabba, the SCG or the MCG — the Indian batting was ruthlessly exposed... even in ODI cricket.The challenge before the Indian batsmen in this tri-series would have been to excel against the Australian pace attack on lively tracks. But then, the Indian batting was simply ripped apart by the home pacemen.Lack of characterIn a revealing piece of statistics, India made 151 at the MCG, 178 at the 'Gabba and 165 at the SCG against the Australians. To put it mildly, the batting lacked character.This is precisely why the team's powerhouse batting display on a run-filled surface at Hobart against Sri Lanka should not be allowed to cloud our judgment vis-a-vis India's performance in the series.Kohli, who has fight and promise, topped the Indian batting averages with 373 runs at 53.28. Gambhir notched up 308 runs at 44, but a majority of his runs (two 90s and a half-century) were made in Adelaide and Hobart. Against, pace, bounce and movement on the other tracks, he too was found wanting.Skipper Mahendra Singh Dhoni (205 at 51.25) continues to be a potent finisher. And his innings of 56 at the 'Gabba against the Aussies was the highest individual Indian score in the three batting collapses against Australia. No other Indian scored a half-century in these matches.Need for sporting tracksMost pitches in India are slow and lack good and consistent bounce. Unless India prepares sporting tracks for its domestic competitions — this is vitally important — the country's future as a cricketing force away from the sub-continent could be bleak.India needs to prepare pitches such as the one used for the Mumbai-Karnataka Ranji Trophy final at Mysore in 2010. Sadly, one hardly gets to see such tracks for domestic cricket during the critical, formative years of our budding players.If the Indian batting was a disappointment here, the bowling was a let down as well.The most successful Indian bowler, Vinay Kumar, was only seventh in the list of wicket-takers — he had nine scalps at 32.11. Vinay is a trier, but is hardly the kind of bowler who can be the spearhead.With Zaheer Khan battling fitness concerns, the Indian attack lacked a leader. Umesh Yadav has pace and heart but lacks consistency.The rest of the Indian pace attack was hardly of the threatening kind. And the spin bowling was nothing more than average.Even if India had progressed to the finals, it might not have made much headway against Australia."

        "Toyota begins Etios exports": "Automobile major Toyota, through its joint venture with the Kirloskar group, on Wednesday, began exporting Etios cars, manufactured at the Bangalore plant, to South Africa. The first batch, of 247 Etios, were loaded on to m.v.Antares Leader , a roll-on-roll-off vessel, at the Ennore port in the presence of two Karnataka Ministers, R. Ashoka and Murugesh R. Nirani, and senior executives of the joint venture, Toyota Kirloskar Motor Private Ltd (TKM), including its Vice-Chairman Vikram Kirloskar. Addressing presspersons after the function, TKM Managing Director Hiroshi Nakagawa said the company was looking to export 20,000 Etios to South Africa annually. In a release, he said with the export of Etios “we have been successful in completing our vision of making Toyota Indian operations a strategic hub for both the domestic and global markets.”Toyota SA Motors (PTY) Ltd Senior Vice-President (Sales and Marketing) Calvyn Hamman said that Etios was expected to help the South African company improve its market share, which it lost, with a presence in the growing small car segment. The demand for smaller vehicles was on the rise in South Africa, he said, adding that Etios would be promoted as an entry-level car for middle class households. The entry-level Etios would be priced at 116,000 Rands (about Rs.7.60 lakh), including the service plan.The export model of Etios is built on the same platform as Etios and Etios Liva, manufactured and sold in India. However, it would be customised to suit the local requirements. The company will export only the petrol variants.Mr. Hamman said the modification included tyres to withstand higher speed. While the average speed on highways in South Africa is 120 kmph, motorists tend to go up to 160 kmph. The size of the automobile market (all vehicles, including trucks) is 5.90 lakh and the share of Toyota SA Motors in it is 18.5 per cent.TKM Deputy Managing Director (Marketing) Sandeep Singh said the company was doing well after the launch of Etios and was focussed on expanding in to semi-urban and rural markets."

        "Ravaging Royals beat Kings XI Punjab": "It was the just the kind of performance Rajasthan Royals needed to keep alive its hopes of making the play-offs and bring a smile on Rahul Dravid's tired face.The team did far too many things right this evening to offset its poor catching. Much before the final ball was bowled, Rajasthan was sure of ending its four-match losing streak by extending Kings XI Punjab's sequence of home defeats to four.For Rajasthan, the thumping 43-run triumph was its fifth, second against Punjab, from 11 matches and placed it in the fifth spot. Kings XI, with an identical record, slipped to the sixth place.After Rajasthan came good to post 177, five out of the six bowlers were among the wickets. Speedster Shaun Tait made his first appearance in this edition of IPL memorable by taking two wickets, same as fellow-Aussie and ‘Man-of-the-match' Shane Watson, who had earlier produced an aggressive 17-ball 36.Off-spinner Johan Botha, too, made his return a fruitful one by claiming two wickets.The Punjab batting never got going with the first six overs producing just 33 runs for the loss of Mandeep Singh and Nitin Saini.Ryan Harris, who took out the Rajasthan openers and finished with two more in the final over, returned his first ever four-wicket haul in this format.But it came on a day when Rajasthan enjoyed a near-perfect day at work.Knowing that no team chasing at this venue had won in four matches this season, Dravid's men batted by choice and set a challenging target.The Rajasthan innings was built on four good knocks with Dravid once again coming good and top-scoring with 46 on a perfect batting strip.But it was Watson who provided the impetus to wipe out the disappointment of the second-over dismissal of in-form Ajinkya Rahane.After Dravid smashed three boundaries in succession off Ryan Harris, and two fours in the next over from Praveen Kumar, Watson smashed a six and two boundaries off Parvinder Awana's first over. The fall of Watson in the eighth over, soon after he hoisted Piyush Chawla for a six, did not slow down the scoring.At the half-way stage, Royals had made 94, its best this season.Ashok Menaria took over from Watson and smashed two sixes off Chawla in the 12th over but lost the company of Dravid who fell to a good catch by Parvinder Awana.Thereafter, it was the 23-ball, 43-run fifth-wicket stand between Brad Hodge and Botha took the tally past 175.ScoreboardRajasthan Royals: R.

        "Solar-powered plane makes history": "Swiss adventurer Bertrand Piccard has flown his way into the record books again after completing the world's first intercontinental flight in a giant solar-powered plane.Mr. Piccard, a 54-year-old balloonist, landed in the Moroccan capital Rabat under a full moon late Tuesday after completing the 19-hour voyage from Madrid on his experimental carbon-fibre aircraft.Mr. Piccard made the first non-stop around-the-world balloon flight 13 years ago. The Solar Impulse is an aircraft as big as an Airbus A340 but as light as an average family car. “Simply the flight over the Gibraltar Strait was a magical moment and represents one of the highlights of my carrier as an aeronaut,” said Mr. Piccard.To qualify as an intercontinental flight, Mr. Piccard had only to cross the Strait of Gibraltar — 14 km at its narrowest point — from Europe to Africa. “Solar Impulse has demonstrated that a solar-powered airplane can fly day and night using no fuel. The next challenge is to fly around the world,” the organisers said on solarimpulse.com.Mr. Piccard took off from Madrid before dawn for the 830-km flight and needed an oxygen mask to breathe in the freezing high altitude as he soared to a maximum height of 27,000 feet (8,230 metres). “For one hour I had the full moon on my right and I had the sunrise on my left and that was absolutely gorgeous,” Mr. Piccard told AFP in an interview from the cockpit. “I had all the colours of the rainbow in the sky and also on the ground.”The crossing of the Gibraltar Strait was one of the most challenging points of the voyage because of the need for oxygen and temperatures that can sink as low as minus 29 degrees Celsius.Each of the motors on the craft — which has a wingspan of over 63 metres — charges 400-kg lithium polymer batteries during the day, allowing the aircraft to carry on flying after dark.“The question is not to use solar power for normal airplanes,” said Mr. Piccard, whose grandfather was the inspiration for the Professor Calculus character in the Tin Tin comics."

Australia trails England by nine ratings points.The annual rankings update is carried out to ensure the championship tables continue to reflect recent form. As such, the new tables only include results from matches played from August 2010, with older results from between August 2009 and July 2010 being discarded.This is the first time England have topped the ODI championship table since it was launched in 2002. It is also the first time England can claim to be the top ODI team since January 1996, after the rankings are applied retrospectively.Below the top four, the ODI rankings are unchanged. However, the gap between seventh-placed West Indies and eighth-ranked New Zealand has grown from six to 20 points, while ninth-placed Bangladesh is now only three points behind New Zealand.Meanwhile, South Africa has replaced England as the top-ranked side on the T20 table.Australia has slipped from sixth position to ninth, as its excellent results in early 2010 have now been removed, while West Indies has moved up from eighth to fifth after benefiting from the exclusion of its results from early 2010.Only 11 teams are now ranked on the T20 table. The remaining five sides — Afghanistan, Canada, Kenya, Netherlands and Scotland — have played fewer than eight Twenty20 internationals since August 2010. These sides will rejoin the table once they have played eight T20 internationals."

        "FAT myths": "Fats are feared by the health conscious, favoured by the gourmet lover and ferociously penned by the medical bodies on its vices or virtues. Fats are let us say, less temperamental unlike carbohydrates that can instantly spike one’s blood sugar or proteins that can give you a sudden allergic reaction. Their effects remain unobtrusive until a blood test or heart attack alerts you to take note of it in your diet.When nutritionists talk about eating low fat the message gets misunderstood, because what they mean is to lower one’s bad fat intake or a presently unhealthy fat diet. They certainly do not mean eating fat free! There are several people who, on being diagnosed with high cholesterol or triglycerides eat without fat and then complain that despite eating no fat, blood lipids do not improve on a long term. A totally fat free diet is unhealthy. It serves no good to the purpose behind it which may be to reduce weight or decrease total or LDL cholesterol.Why we need fatsFats are essential to the body just as are proteins and carbohydrates. Apart from being the denser source of energy than carbohydrate or proteins, fat also protects proteins from being broken down for energy. Most of our muscles require fatty acids for energy. The adipose tissue (commonly referred to as fat) insulates the body, maintaining the body heat and temperature. Adipose tissue is what cushions our organs and protects them from external trauma.Fat in food is essential to transport and absorb fat soluble vitamins like A, D and E. Fat in food also delays gastric emptying and buffers gastric juices. Fat brings out the flavour of foods and lends satiety to the meal. Fat gives shapes our body.What is right and how much is good?There is a basic rule of eating fat which is undisputedly agreed upon by scientists everywhere. That is to “eat the right kind of fats in the right amount”. There are the good – the mono and poly unsaturated fats (MUFA and PUFA), bad – saturated (SFA), and very bad fats – trans fatty acids. Going into the composition of these is beyond the scope of this article, nor its purpose. But what is necessary here is learning how to eat fats in one’s diet.Eat your fat and stay healthyNumerous researches point to the fact that to control cholesterol changing from saturated to monounsaturated fats help irrespective of the quantity of fat consumed as versus reducing fat and instead increasing refined carbohydrates.Calories from fat should constitute 30 to 35 per cent of total calories. This means for an adult moderately active, say on 2400 kcal/day, 80grams of fat in a day. Now, note that this includes both added fats like ghee, butter, oils in cooking, and those naturally found in nuts, seeds, avocadoes, olives, beans, grated coconut, whole milk or curds, egg, fish, poultry, meat.Present recommendations are zero TFA and restricted SFA - to about 7 per cent of fat calories in a day. Majority of the remaining should come ideally from monounsaturated fats. We can only classify oils as predominantly MUFA, PUFA or SFA because all oils contain a mix of unsaturated and saturated fats.Since we do not eat by percentages, how can a good proportion be achieved?•The only kind of fats that you need to totally avoid are partially hydrogenated fats - found in commercial foods, fast foods, processed foods•Keep saturated fats to a minimum. This is achieved by not eating red meat, using low fat or skimmed milk and curds and using ghee and butter sparingly. Sources of SFA are ghee, butter, mayonnaise, animal fats, fat in milk and curds, tropical oils - coconut and palm oils, coconut milk.•Use more of oils like sesame, peanut, soybean, olive, corn, safflower for cooking. Look for the word high oleic while choosing cooking oils. Use two or three kinds in a day. For example, use sesame oil at breakfast time, Sunflower for preparing lunch and olive for dinner. Keep changing the oils frequently.•Use some kind of seeds and nuts especially flaxseeds, peanuts and sesame seeds daily.•Skip red meat and eat fish. Cook fatty fish in its own fat, or make sure you use up the fat from the fish.(The writer is a dietician based in Kochi)"

        "Flipora set to hit the stratosphere": "Flipora, a web service that is attempting to rewrite the rules of engagement on the way we discover content on the web — moving away from the now standard “social graph” to an “interest graph” — has gained some critical momentum in recent months.The web discovery engine constantly analyses its users’ preferences through algorithms that study signals people send out while skimming through content. Using those, the engine “pushes” suggested reading and thus differs from the “pull” paradigm of other search engines where the users key in their queries to pull up information. The premise is that the web is just too big to just browse based on keywords or what one’s friends recommend.Indian connectionWhat makes the story even more exciting is that it is founded by two Indian graduates from Stanford University.These are exciting times for Jonathan Siddharth and Vijay Krishnan, students from the class of 2007-08, who are seeing their Silicon Valley start-up gather steam. Their service reached its 10-millionth user mark recently, acquiring users from over 200 countries. The speed at which the company is growing is also cause for celebration — it took Flipora 45 days to go from the 8-million to the 9-million mark but just 25 days to go from the 9-million to the 10-million mark.The start-up has so far raised funds close to $3.9 million through two rounds of funding from prominent Silicon Valley firms such as DFJ (backers of Skype, Paypal, Hotmail, Baidu, SpaceX, etc.), Labrador Ventures, Band of Angels, Amidzad Partners and Steve Oskoui (Smiley Media). It now has 20 employees and is headquartered at Sunnyvale, California, in Silicon Valley.At their current pace, and based on their revenues from Google AdWords, Mr. Siddharth and Mr. Krishnan hope to break even and turn in the profits the first quarter of next year. “If things go as good as they are right now, we might never need any further funding,” says Mr. Siddharth hopefully.Discovery engineFlipora started out as Infoaxe in late 2008, a service that in its initial stages came across as a “complete registry” of a user’s online activities. Using a web browser plugin, the entire history of one’s browsing would be ranked and stored, just to answer the question — “What was that site I fleetingly looked at when I was browsing two months back?”Re-finding queriesA 2007 study by a group of students from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology found that nearly 40 per cent of all search queries were re-finding queries. By banking on a user’s entire web history to help search for particular data, relevance of results improves dramatically.But in July this year, Mr. Siddharth and Mr. Krishnan re-branded their service as ‘Flipora’ and used the same underlying logic to help users discover new websites based on the interests that their browsing habits showed.Today, users can register with Flipora with details about their areas of interests and start browsing recommended content from like-minded users the world over. The service has been adding several categories and has also incorporated certain algorithms that make the process both fun and smart. In some ways, this is the kind of discovery of content that has faded away because of the impact of Facebook and Twitter.Refining categoriesIn a few ways, Flipora comes across as being similar to Pinterest and Quora. But they are some key differentiators too. Pinterest is more picture-oriented and Quora can come across as a tad geeky. Flipora is more about articles and content recommendations. Mr. Siddharth says they have been refining the categories.Flipora also has an option for its users to follow certain ‘recommended curators’ helping users understand what sort of interests they might share with them. Popular singer Seal has expressed interest in being featured as a recommended user with the service.As the Flipora discovery engine gets closer to its tipping point, Mr. Siddharth and Mr. Krishnan are planning the big push forward that should come next year. Their idea is to make Flipora a third-party discovery plugin that would be incorporated into sites in a way similar to how “social graphs” of networks such as Facebook and Twitter are plugged into sites today. They call their project the “interest graph.”“Won’t it make more sense if the e-commerce website you are browsing throws up recommendations based on your interests rather than your friend’s interests,” asks Mr. Krishnan."

If you see the last few games, he has batted beautifully. There has been a lot of improvement in his batting.“I like him whenever he is aggressive.

In tough times, the people who will really support you are your team members and the support staff. We have kept it really close.“And the good things is that we are enjoying ourselves, which at times you don’t tend to do when you go through a rough patch. So when it comes to the atmosphere in the dressing room, it’s really good.”Dhoni showed he was focussed on his job. “If you are part of Indian cricket, you’ll see that everything is under the microscope and everyone has an opinion.“The good thing or the bad thing is that everybody asks questions, but nobody comes up with a solution.“That’s the brilliant part of it. People who have covered cricket for a long time know that once you have a result, there are easy questions on why that guy wasn’t picked or why this guy wasn’t given the new ball and something else.“In cricket, there are always a lot of questions. So we are under the microscope throughout our lives.”The India skipper did not mind criticism from past cricketers.“As ex-cricketers, we respect their opinion. But we have our own problems to solve. We need to look at how we get everything right and not worry about things that are not in our control.“All these people are reputed ex-cricketers who have played for India, so we respect their opinions. But we have other problems that need to be solved.”Dhoni concluded by highlighting the role played by Sachin Tendulkar and Virender Sehwag. “It’s not that when a captain goes up to a bowler, he passes on some great advice (guru-mantra) to the bowlers.“We have Viru and Sachin who are senior players and can help the bowlers. But ultimately it’s up to the bowlers to execute the plans. I have also always believed that it’s important not to spoon feed anyone.“We meet every hour when the drinks happen. There is no need to spread panic. Viru and Sachin keep having chats with the bowlers when they stand in mid-on and mid-off.”"

        "Smartphones become life’s remote control": "The smartphone is no longer just a portable computer in your pocket. It has become the remote control for your life.Want to flip off the living room lights, unlock your front door, or get a reading of your blood pressure? All of this can be done through mobile apps that work with accessories embedded with sensors or an Internet connection.For several years, technology companies have promised the dream of the connected home, the connected body and the connected car. Those connections have proved illusory. But in the last year app-powered accessories have provided the mechanism to actually make the connections. That is partly because smartphones have become the device people never put down. But it is also because wireless sensors have become smaller, cheaper and ubiquitous.Big companies with strong brands have been heavily promoting the new uses for these gadgets. General Motors advertises its Chevy Malibu Eco with a man showing his parents how he starts the car with a smartphone. A major selling point of the popular Nest thermostat is its ability to turn up the furnace from miles away with a cellphone.The idea of turning off the lights with a smartphone may seem gimmicky, but consumers are warming to applications, said Bill Scheffler, director of business development for the Z-Wave Alliance, a consortium of companies that make connected appliances. The situation resembles the time when power windows started catching on for automobiles, Scheffler said.“It used to be that people would say, why does anybody want a remote control for a TV if you can get up and change the channel?’’ he said. “It’s just progress.’’ At the International Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, which has attracted more than 150,000 people last week, dozens of companies are showing off connected accessories they can hook up to their home appliances to make them work with smartphones, and many are also displaying wearable devices that can help people monitor their health on their phones. AT&T, the wireless carrier, said that in March it will begin selling a wireless security system called Digital Life that will allow people to use tablets or phones to monitor cameras, alarms and even coffeepots.If a burglar trips a motion sensor in the house, for example, a user can receive a text message, then call the police. Customers can choose to expand AT&T's wireless service to appliances like lights, door locks, thermostats and security cameras, which can be controlled and monitored through the AT&T mobile app.Ingersoll Rand, which makes industrial products, offers a $300 starter kit and software for people to connect their homes. It includes a lock, a light and a wireless ‘bridge,’ or base station, to connect the devices to the Internet. At the electronics show, IHealth introduced a wireless glucose meter, called the Smart Glucometer, that lets people with diabetes determine their blood sugar. A user puts a blood sample on a test strip, pops it into an accessory attached to a smartphone, and an app gives a reading of the blood sugar level.— New York Times News Service"

        "Not for sale": " Tamil Nadu’s deceased donor organ retrieval programme is a good example of a transparent, State-led initiative that can demonstrably curb trade in human organs. It is not by accident that the programme has achieved a donation rate for kidneys, livers, hearts and lungs that is many times higher than the national average; last year, nearly half of all donations from dead donors in India were in Tamil Nadu. A combination of socially-minded medical professionals, supportive governments and high levels of openness has encouraged several families to altruistically give away the organs of their kin who suffer brain stem death, mostly in road traffic accidents. The Tamil Nadu model, recently featured by BMJ (the British Medical Journal) as a replicable framework for other States, has many aspects that merit close attention. What stands out in its design is the requirement that all hospitals doing transplant surgeries register with a State authority, offer counselling to the kin of potential donors, submit records of transplants and declare their charges. The online publication of waiting lists, the hospitals involved and guidelines for allocation of organs has strengthened public confidence in the system. Notably, many recipients are poor. It is no secret that the evolution of such a forward-looking measure in Tamil Nadu is the response to an unedifying past — one that made the State notorious for trade in kidneys procured by middlemen from living donors, mostly the poor. Commerce in organs continues in many other parts of the country, exploiting a provision in the Transplantation of Human Organs Act that allows living unrelated people to give, for reasons of attachment to or affection for the recipient. This must be countered forcefully by promoting the cadaver donation model. Even Tamil Nadu can do a lot more, by devoting attention to trauma units in district hospitals, where cadavers can be maintained for organ donation, and doctors trained to identify brain stem death and perform transplants. Commendably, the expertise acquired thus far by the State is being widely shared with health systems across the country, and there can be no excuse for others not to institute similar programmes. It is, of course, vital to remember that the major supply of cadaveric organs comes from the shocking number of road accidents that kill over 134,000 people a year. On the other hand, organ demand is also inexorably rising due to weak preventive measures and treatment access for diabetes and hypertension. Free public provision of dialysis, which is currently unaffordable in the private sector to most patients, can help many with end-stage kidney disease. Curbing organ commerce needs a national initiative."

Uzbekistan came from behind to win 5-1 at home against Qatar in a simultaneous game. The storming finish ultimately came up short, leaving the Uzbeks on a plus-five goal difference while South Korea was plus-six.The winning goal came in the 60th minute. Kim Young-gwon failed to clear a speculative ball forward and Reza Ghoochannejad robbed him of possession, sprinted clear and sent a well-placed curling left-foot shot beyond goalkeeper Jung Sung-ryeong.South Korea, not wanting to put its fate in the hands of the game in Uzbekistan, pressed forward strongly for the remainder of the game but could not equalize.Kim almost made up for his mistake, but his close-range shot in the 86th minute produced a reflex save from keeper Rahman Ahmadi and Jang Hyun-soo’s follow-up was also blocked.As Iran players, coach Carlos Queiroz and officials celebrated wildly on the pitch, the South Korean squad and fans were kept in suspense while the last couple of minutes of the Uzbekistan game were played out, before they knew they were also through to next year’s tournament in Brazil.South Korea’s trip to Brazil will be its eighth-straight World Cup appearance including one as co—host in 2002 while Iran qualified for the World Cup for the fourth time, having missed out on South Africa 2010."

        "Bird haven": "The manjal konrai stands tall and gracious with its yellow blooms at Kadri Mills School near Ondipudur. “It’s 60,” says D. Krishnaveni, the head mistress. An alumnus of the school, she adds: “Our school is 60 years old and so are some of the pungan, fig, neem, vaadha narayani, naaval, and poovarasan trees here.” The konrai is home to a number of night herons too. “After the monsoons, the tree is a riot of yellow flowers, and the herons build nests on the tree trunks,” says zoology teacher R. Selvi.At the entrance, we walk past medicinal plants such as thoothuvaalai and nandyar vattam; and ornamental pink balsams, nithyakalyani and pink arali that brighten up the environs. “Our morning prayer session followed by meditation under the shade of the trees gives a good start to our day. The arasa maram and vembu purify air and ensure a healthy environment,” says Krishnaveni.In the last five years, the students have, along with the Forest Department and organisations such as Siruthuli, Isha Yoga Centre and the Alumni Association of the School, distributed over 4,000 saplings to nearby panchayats, temples and homes. Showing them the way is Selvi, who inspires her students to explore and conserve Nature.Selvi takes me on a tour of the trees at the campus. There’s an open playground bordered by trees — white, yellow, red, and pink flowers dot the green landscape. “Our students regularly raise saplings and distribute them in the neighbourhood. Recently, a group of students nurtured 650 saplings and gave them to the nearby Pallapalayam Panchayat,” she says.The students also take turns to water and nurture the greenery. They participate in tree planting awareness rallies and spread the word on a clean and green environment.Pigeons visit the campus in hundreds. So do black kites and peacocks. Other regular visitors are little cormorants, little egrets, mynahs, owls, babblers, golden oriole, sunbirds, golden-backed woodpeckers, white-throated kingfishers, and white-headed babblers. As the Noyyal river bank is just around the corner, they regularly spot painted storks and darters too.Selvi and her students have recorded over 67 species of birds on the campus. We look up and spot a number of little cormorants (neer kaagai) in flight as they travel from Sulur Lake to Singanallur. “Thousands of little cormorants flock the school campus in the evenings. One of our students watched the birds for 30 days, recorded the nature of flight, feeding place and the roosting ground and presented the project at Children’s Science Congress. One particular day, she saw about 9,000 birds.”There’s a pleasant whiff of fragrance in the playground. It comes from the Maramalli tree. Popularly called jasmine tree or paneer poo, it bears long-stalked white flowers in bunches. “We see sunbirds feeding on the nectar of maramalli flowers. Some of the trees have honeycombs and the honey buzzard visits such trees for honey. The trees are a nesting abode for mynahs, eagles and squirrels,” says Selvi.The green cover is now extended to Kadri Mills Elementary School too, which is next door. The campus already looks cheerful, with healthy saplings of poovarasan, maramalli and manjal konrai.(How green is your neighbourhood?

It is only worried about saving its chair,” Mr. Modi said.The Indian rupee continued its slide this morning, breaching the 64-mark against dollar by falling 98 paise to trade at a record low of 64.11.He lambasted the Centre for not taking any steps to strengthen the currency against the US dollar.“The rupee has fallen rapidly in the past three months. But the government has not taken any steps to strengthen the rupee against the US dollar. If the rupee keeps falling like this, other countries will start taking advantage of India,” Mr. Modi said.Terming the leadership as direction less, the PM-aspirant said, “The country might have never imagined that it would face such an economic crisis. But when leadership during such a crisis is directionless, then hopelessness increases. The Centre has not taken any step to instil confidence among people.”“For the last five years, every three months, we have been hearing from the Centre that prices will come down and inflation will be controlled but nothing has happened,” Mr. Modi stated.Pitching himself firmly as BJP’s prime ministerial candidate even before being formally anointed, Mr. Modi had on August 15 launched a blistering attack on the Prime Minister on national security and challenged him to a public debate on governance, saying the nation is “restless for change“.He had also slammed Dr. Singh for India’s “weak and feeble” response to provocations from Pakistan and China and attacked him over a variety of issues ranging from corruption to the Centre’s flagship food security bill.On repeated ceasefire violations by Pakistan and Chinese incursion along the line of actual control (LAC), Mr. Modi said, “For the last few days, Pakistan and China have been attacking our nation and our jawans. If we are not able to protect them (soldiers), then how can they protect our nation?”Talking about the Raksha bandhan festival being celebrated today, he said, “I have experienced that while serving the society and the nation I am protected by the ‘kavach’ (armour) of strength given by the women of India. Due to this I can overcome various challenges. Also I am inspired to serve the poorest of the poor, the marginalised.”As per the statement posted on Mr. Modi’s official website, a number of women from across the country and abroad tied rakhis to him on the occasion."

        "It’s a weak deal at Warsaw": "Negotiators gathered at the Polish capital sealed the new climate change agreement avoiding a crash late in the evening on Saturday. But, this required the countries to also lock themselves to a compromised agreement with a low level of ambition to fight climate change.Against a backdrop of developed countries unwilling to neither increase their short-term emission reduction targets nor provide a road-map to capitalise the existing Green Climate Fund nor show leadership on framing of the elements of the 2015 climate agreement, the fortnight of talks took the global community only an inch forward in the fight against climate change and not a leap that was expected.Where the end-game became about developed countries trying primarily to break the fire-wall between rich and developing countries under the U.N. climate convention, India was able to secure its red-lines and make sure that it had not been harmed on issues of value and marked out by the government for attention.A relatively weak mechanism for addressing Loss and Damage from inevitable climate change was set up — a far cry from the kind the poor countries had initially asked for. But, with the U.S. and some other developed countries playing hardball on the issue till late, the small and vulnerable countries decided to live with what they were able to get through a last moment gambit at the talks.A rather loose road-map was drawn up for mobilising monies towards the $100 billion annually by 2020 was also drawn up though the map forgot to find a mid-term peg which had been demanded all through.India playing closely with other BASIC countries and the Like-Minded Developing Countries were able to withstand the pressure and diplomatic games of the developed countries to try and drive a hole in the existing firewall between rich and poor nations in the context of the new climate agreement which is to be signed in 2015.At the time of filing of the story a few procedural elements of completion remained but they promised to throw few surprises or block any of the decisions reported."

        "Black skin, a response to skin cancer risk": "The ability of ultraviolet radiation to cause skin cancer is well established. Yet, it is only “generally believed” that the development of dark skin by people in Africa was an adaptive response to protect them from the damaging effects of UV rays. Also, the harmful impact of UV rays in the survival and/or reproductive fitness of individuals is “uncertain.” But a paper published on February 26 in the Proceedings of the Royal Society B reports evidence that dark skin evolved in early humans living in Africa to protect them from the damaging effects of UV radiation. It provides proof that skin cancer can affect young people in the reproductive age. Unlike light-skinned people, dark-skinned people have relatively lesser risk of suffering from skin cancer. And even if they do have skin cancer, it is typically restricted to the soles and palms that are less pigmented. The reason — the presence of brown/black eumelanin in dark-skinned people that filters out the UV radiation. So much so that dark-skinned people enjoy a 500- to 1,000-fold protection compared with light-skinned people.But hominins who lived some 2-3 million years ago in the East African savannah were probably not black skinned. The loss of body hair to facilitate sweating and heat loss (thermoregulation) for the first time exposed the bare skin, which was about white or pale. The skin of chimpanzees — our nearest primate relative — under its thick fur of hair is pale or white.Genetic evidence suggests that about 1.2 to 1.8 million years ago Africans living in the hot, open savannah that has highest levels of UVB radiation throughout the year were under selective pressure to retain a variant of MC1R gene that encodes for effective dark colouration of the skin (melanization).But the key notion that skin cancer served as a selective force for the development of dark skin has been dismissed on the grounds that lethal skin cancer is rarely seen in young people during the reproductive years.The author of the study Mel Greaves from the Institute of Cancer Research, Sutton, Surrey, U.K., cites the high incidence of skin cancer at a young age in albinos — who are white-skinned due to a disorder of melanin pigmentation — to question the misconception. Albinos are seen in black ethnic groups throughout sub-Saharan Africa (1 in 5,000), Ibo in Nigeria and the Tongo in Zimbabwe (1 in 1,000).The prevalence of skin cancer in African albinos in low latitude countries like Tanzania, Cameroon, and Nigeria is high and it occurs at an early age. While focal skin lesions can be seen in children as young as five years, overt skin cancer can be seen in most albinos by the age of 20 years.Albinos in several other low-latitude countries like India, Papua New Guinea and Panama run the same high risk of developing skin cancer. Albino mice exposed to UV radiation suffer similarly.These examples “endorse the plausibility that black pigmentation could have arisen in early pale-skinned hominins as a defence against lethal skin cancer,” the paper notes."

He acknowledged the cheers with folded hands.Pawan devoted a greater part of his hour-long speech to lash out at the Congress for bifurcating the State and the need to fight against the corrupt political system. He said that the Congress had destroyed the integrity of not only Andhra Pradesh but also of the nation. Recalling the words of the Telugu poet Maha Kavi Gurajada Appa Rao, he said for the Congress leaders it was ‘Desamante, Congress High Command’.Giving the reasons which made him float the new party, Pavan said: “During the last 10 years, I am fed up with this corrupt political system. I want to pull up all such political gamblers, who change their ‘kanduva’ colours during every election and those who promote caste and communal politics. This corrupt political system should be pulled out by its roots.”He said that he had floated the party to recognise and promote selfless and principled leaders. He called for a total revolution to put the nation on the path of progress.In an obvious reference to KCR, he said that statements of some leaders that they would attack and not allow people of Seemandhra to come to their region, would not be taken lying down. “Though I believe in Gandhian principles, even the Mahatma had asked us not to tolerate injustice. We are capable of hitting such people on both cheeks, if they hit us on one cheek,” he said.All praise for ModiReferring to his meeting with BJP prime ministerial candidate Narendra Modi, he said that he found an able leader in Mr. Modi, who could oppose injustice without any fear.

        "Pogba propels France into last eight": "A Paul Pogba header and a Joseph Yobo own goal saw France edge a hard-fought contest with Nigeria 2-0 in Brasilia on Monday to reach the World Cup quarter-finals.Pogba broke the deadlock in the 79th minute, heading into an empty net after Nigeria goalkeeper Vincent Enyeama, who plays for French club Lille, failed to collect a corner.It was a cruel moment for Enyeama, but rewarded a barrage of French pressure sparked by the introduction of Antoine Griezmann, who forced Yobo to put through his own goal in injury time.Didier Deschamps's France will now await the winners of Monday's other last-16 tie between Germany and Algeria, who they will meet at the Maracana in Rio de Janeiro on July 4.African champions Nigeria, meanwhile, must wait to sample the last eight at a World Cup, following defeat in their first knockout-phase match at the tournament since the 1998 competition in France.Stephen Keshi's side nonetheless departed to the sound of warm applause from the fans crammed into the cavernous Mane Garrincha National Stadium, who allied themselves with Nigeria's cause from the kick-off.While France, who showed six changes, started purposefully, their final ball frequently let them down, which handed Nigeria opportunities to use their pace on the counter-attack.Emmanuel Emenike thought he had put Nigeria ahead in the 19th minute when he deftly prodded in an in-swinging cross from Ahmed Musa, but the offside flag allowed French heart rates to return to normal.France looked more threatening when they were able to bring the recalled Mathieu Valbuena into the game.When the Marseille midfielder teed up Pogba for a vicious volley mid-way through the first half, it took a stunning reflex save from Enyeama to keep the game scoreless.Onazi stretchered offAnother intelligent pass from Valbuena then gave Mathieu Debuchy a sight of goal, but the Newcastle United right-back drilled wide.Late in the first half Emenike took aim from range, but Hugo Lloris was able to parry.Nigeria suffered a blow early in the second period when Lazio midfielder Ogenyi Onazi had to be stretchered off after an ugly, ankle-high challenge by Blaise Matuidi, who escaped with only a caution.Faced with growing Nigeria pressure, Deschamps introduced Griezmann in place of Olivier Giroud with half an hour to play and the move quickly paid immediate dividends.After Lloris had saved from Peter Odemwingie, a one-two between Karim Benzema and Griezmann set the Real Madrid man clear, but although he squeezed the ball past Enyeama, Victor Moses was on hand to hook clear.It was to prove a temporary reprieve. Yohan Cabaye, back from suspension, saw a 20-yard half-volley crash back off the bar before Enyeama had to produce a finger-tip save to touch a Benzema header over the bar.It was the second fine stop of the match from the 31-year-old, but seconds later his failure to claim Valbuena's left-wing corner allowed Juventus midfielder Pogba to head in at the back post.Enyeama then palmed a shot from Griezmann over the bar, but France made it 2-0 at the death when Yobo, under pressure from Griezmann, inadvertently steered Valbuena's drilled cross into his own net."

The World Cup will be played starting Aug. 30 in Spain, and Ginobili’s loss is a big blow for Argentina’s chances.Ginobili played through the injury while helping the Spurs beat the Miami Heat in the NBA Finals. He has long relished international competition, but the San Antonio Express-News first reported earlier this week that the Spurs requested Ginobili not play in Spain because of the lingering issue.The Spurs have good reason to be concerned.In 2008, Ginobili injured his ankle in the playoffs and then played for Argentina in the Olympics. In Beijing, Ginobili did further damage to the ankle that ultimately required surgery and contributed to an injury plagued 2008-09 NBA season. Ginobili missed the playoffs that season and the Spurs were defeated in the first round by Dallas.Ginobili has played internationally for Argentina since 1998, including the nation’s thrilling victory over the Americans en route to winning the gold medal in the 2004 Olympics."

In fact, Manuel Pellegrini’s side overtook the Toffees in the table only after it won the fixture 3-1.Everton, though, has failed to replicate last season’s promising start in this campaign as Europa League commitments bear a heavy toll on the side.A turnaround in fortunes seems unlikely on Saturday as Roberto Martinez has never defeated City in the league (played 10, drawn one, lost nine).In-form Sergio Aguero will severely test Everton’s back four of Seamus Coleman, Sylvain Distin, Phil Jagielka and Leighton Baines.The Argentinean has already scored 14 times in the league, more than Sunderland (13), Burnley (10) and Aston Villa (eight).After an uncertain start to the season, City has seemingly found its feet as it has won its last three league matches.However, Pellegrini will have to do without the services of skipper Vincent Kompany as the Belgian continues to recover from his hamstring injury.As City plays Roma in a crucial Champions League match on Wednesday, it is unlikely that David Silva will be rushed back for this game either.Eliaquim Mangala will return from his one-match suspension and seems likely to replace Dedryck Boyata.For Everton, James McCarthy remains doubtful.So, the central midfield pairing of Gareth Barry and Muhamed Besic could continue."

The little tribute there beforehand put those memories back in place, seeing that little smile up on the board before going out there and singing the national anthem was quite hard.“I had a minute to myself when I came off before we went onto the field of play at the beginning of the day and I had my head in the towel.

        "Creating reflective spaces": "I don't know about you, but I feel like I am being constantly bombarded by information and opinion and I’m consumed by the urgent need to keep up. Every time I click on my Twitter feed I find I have missed hundreds of tweets. My Facebook news feed runs many screens deep and when I turn on the television, the screen is filled not only with people shouting their ideas at me but with strips of breaking news rapidly sliding past my slow-reading eyes. If you’ve subscribed to a news aggregator or curating app like Flipboard, there are even more articles waiting for you to click on. And finally, there is the newspaper that arrives on the doorstep when the overnight news has cooled, reminding you that there is still a lot that one doesn’t know. And if you’re in college, there are the fat books waiting to be read, the papers you’ve downloaded by the dozen and are yet to open, and your classmate’s notes you still have to copy. However, this curricular information seems insignificant when compared to the stories jostling for attention on your social media pages. James Glieck, in his book The Information: a History, a Theory, a Flood (Fourth Estate, 2011), describes the ways in which we are submerged in information, so much so we have forgotten that sometimes there’s a need to come up for air! We are worried that unless we keep up with every little byte, we will be left behind, maybe even fall into the crack of the digital divide! Information overloadThis condition — the overwhelming sense that we need to keep up with the flood of information—has come to be called ‘information anxiety’, and is a significant feature of the modern, networked world. There are two ways in which this anxiety manifests itself. One, we want to be kept in the loop on current events and issues, things that everyone is talking about. We do this by using social networking sites to keep up with friends’ opinions and lives, or to follow journalists or other information providers.Two, we create alerts on Google or other search engines so that we can be ‘pinged’ when something new has been posted relating to an area we are interested in. I know students who frantically download every new article related to their field of research, and before they know it, their folders are bulging with hundreds of scholarly publications that they would need years to read.The first kind leads us to a situation where we are continuously engaged in something like an imaginary conversation. The give and take is immediate and takes little reflection. I have spoken before about the repercussions of this kind of instantaneous exchange. The second kind makes us feel that we cannot look away even for a second or we might miss something important in the world of research and knowledge production. The act of downloading articles gives us some comfort, making it seem like we at least have everything in our own personal storehouse (unless the hard drive crashes in protest).Engage with itSo what is the problem with this? In the first instance, the continuous exposure to other people’s points of view and the unending stream of information leave us little or no time to reflect on what we hear and form our own opinions. In the second, it’s clear that we spend too much time acquiring a store of information and knowledge and have too little time to engage with it.To build understanding and to nurture our own ways of thinking, we need to carve out silent spaces where we are alone with our own thoughts. Yes, there is value in discussion and conversation, and of course there is much to be gained from keeping track of the latest ideas. But unless we allow ourselves the room where we can look at those ideas by ourselves, undisturbed by the varied and often discordant opinions that usually surround us, we will not be challenged to think creatively and independently.It’s probably a good idea to define a part of each day when you are not searching for information, but engaging with it. Rather than looking at what ten different experts are saying about something, look at the issue yourself and arrive at what you might want to say about it beyond a simple “agree” or “disagree.” Stop yourself after you download five articles from a database and spend the next few hours reading them and making notes.We need to unplug and read…quietly. We need to pull our heads out of that flood of information and come up for air. We need to get rid of the sense that “keeping up” is about knowing what everyone else is saying about something. It’s really about formulating what you would like to say, and why.And in the spirit of making some space for reflection, the Backpacker’s Guide will take a break for a few months and be back in the month of June.The author teaches at the University of Hyderabad and edits Teacher Plus magazine.

It has 150 employees.The expanded facility will initially make its popular SUV (sports utility vehicle), the GLA. The GLA was imported and introduced in the Indian market in September 2014 and according to Eberhard Kern, Managing Director and CEO, Mercedes-Benz India Ltd. (MBIL), the local production will result in a drop in the price of the product by Rs.1.5-2.5 lakh for the two variants.The GLA 200 CDI Style, priced earlier at Rs.32.75 lakh, will now be sold at Rs.31.31 lakh, while the GLA 200 CDI Sport will see a price drop from Rs.36.9 lakh to Rs.34.25 lakh.The GLA is the six product from Mercedes-Benz to be assembled locally. The other products include S-Class, E-Class, C-Class, M-Class, GL-Class and now the GLA.“We wanted to make the CLA here but the tremendous response the GLA got resulted in our preponing its local production. Local production of the CLA will happen in the next few months,’’ he said.While the company had not yet decided on local production of A Class and B Class, the overall level of localisation is at 60 per cent. “To cross this, we would have to make parts locally. That would make sense only with much higher volumes — in the range of 70,000-80,000 units per annum for a model.’’He said India’s luxury car segment accounted for 1.3 per cent of the Indian car market with sales of around 33,000 units in 2014. “On the back of improved sales, I expect this to reach 40,000 units in 2015,” he added."

        "With fiery speeches, Pope launches ‘holy war’ on capitalism": "His speeches can blend biblical fury with apocalyptic doom. Pope Francis does not just criticise the excesses of global capitalism. He compares them to the “dung of the devil.” He does not simply argue that systemic “greed for money” is a bad thing. He calls it a “subtle dictatorship” that “condemns and enslaves men and women.”Having returned to his native Latin America, Francis has renewed his left-leaning critiques on the inequalities of capitalism, describing it as an underlying cause of global injustice, and a prime cause of climate change.Pope Francis escalated that line last week when he made a historic apology for the crimes of the Roman Catholic Church during the period of Spanish colonialism — even as he called for a global movement against a “new colonialism” rooted in an inequitable economic order. The Argentine pope seemed to be asking for a social revolution.Francis has defined the economic challenge of this era as the failure of global capitalism to create fairness, equity and dignified livelihoods for the poor — a social and religious agenda that coincides with a resurgence of the leftist thinking marginalised in the days of John Paul II. Francis’ increasingly sharp critique comes as much of humanity has never been so wealthy or well fed — yet rising inequality and repeated financial crises have unsettled voters, policymakers and economists.Left-wing populism is surging in countries immersed in economic turmoil, such as Spain, and, most notably, Greece. But even in the United States, where the economy has rebounded, widespread concern about inequality and corporate power are propelling the rise of liberals. Francis made his speech Wednesday night in Santa Cruz, Bolivia, before nearly 2,000 social activists, farmers, trash workers and neighbourhood activists. Even as he meets regularly with heads of state, Francis has often said change must come from the grass roots, whether from poor people or the community organisers who work with them.To Francis, the poor have earned knowledge that is useful and redeeming, even as a “throwaway culture” tosses them aside. He sees them as being the front edge of economic and environmental crises around the world.In Bolivia, Francis praised cooperatives and other localised organisations that he said provided productive economies for the poor. “How different this is than the situation that results when those left behind by the formal market are exploited like slaves,” he said Wednesday night.It is this Old Testament-like rhetoric that some finding jarring, perhaps especially so in the United States, where Francis will visit in September. His right-leaning critics also argued he was overreaching and straying dangerously beyond religion - while condemning capitalism with too broad a brush.“I wish Francis would focus on positives, on how a free-market economy guided by an ethical framework, and the rule of law, can be a part of the solution for the poor — rather than just jumping from the reality of people’s misery to the analysis that a market economy is the problem,” said the Rev. Robert A. Sirico, president of the Acton Institute for the Study of Religion and Liberty, which advocates free-market economics.— New York Times News Service"

We have now much more profitable business and flexible production line. So, we are now in a position to look at launching products in low end segment. The upcoming Auto show, to be held in in New Delhi in early 2016 will showcase the new models we propose to roll out during next year,” Philipp von Sahr, President, BMW Group India told The Hindu here.Earlier, BMW India today introduced the new X5M and X6M performance SUVs priced at Rs.1.55 crore and Rs.1.6 crore (ex-showroom, New Delhi) respectively. Both the models will be sold as completely built units (CBUs)."

        "Heiress to a tradition": "Acharyas and interpreters have paid glowing tributes to Andal and her works that are part of the Nalayira Divya Prabandha. Her fame is equal if not more than that of the Azhwars put together and she is hailed as the only heiress to their devotional tradition, pointed out Sri L. Sampathkumar in a lecture.In terms of numbers, her contribution to the 4,000 strong hymns of the Divya Prabandha is a mere 173 — with the Tiruppavai of 30 verses and the Nachiyar Tirumozhi of 143. But the qualitative worth of these, in terms of poesy, literary excellences, simplicity, devotional content, and philosophical merit remain unparalleled.As Goda, she shows the way to devotion by being an ardent lover of Krishna. But how is one to win Krishna’s love? Is there any instance of anyone who has loved the Lord and attained Him? Learning that the numerous Gopis in Ayarpadi had attained Krishna by sheer love, and that they had observed the Katyayani Vrata in the month of Marghazhi for this purpose, Andal too undertakes a Paavai Nombu in Srivilliputhur which now becomes Ayarpadi in her imagination. Many may not know the verses of the Divya Prabandha in full, but it is a fact that the Tiruppavai has become a household hymn and continues to instil devotion of an infectious nature in the young and old alike. Behind the simple Tamil and the seemingly simple ritual of the Nombu one is able to easily experience the Lord’s Saulabhya that co-exists with His unquestioned Supremacy. One need not feel diffident of one’s sins, sanchita and prarabdha, if one surrenders at His feet and is penitent.He alone can guide the jivatma from distractions and grant Moksha."

        "Himalayan glacier controversy: Jairam Ramesh says India vindicated": "As the controversy over retreating Himalayan glaciers took a new turn, Environment Minister Jairam Ramesh on Monday said, India stood vindicated with a UN body moving to retract its own “alarmist” warning that the glaciers would melt by 2035 due to climate change.Ramesh slammed as ‘alarmist’ the warning by Rajendra Pachauri’s Nobel-prize winning Inter-government Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) that the glaciers would vanish and said it was without any scientific basis.Pachauri, who is the IPCC Chairman, washed his hands of the controversy saying he has “absolutely no responsibility”“The health of the glaciers is a cause of grave concern but the IPCC’s alarmist position that the glaciers will vanish by 2035 was not based on an iota of scientific evidence,” Ramesh told reporters.Ramesh’s comments came following a report the warning that most of the Himalayan glaciers will melt by 2035 owing to climate change is likely to be retracted after the UN body that issued it admitted to a series of scientific blunders.“Infact, we had issued a report (by scientist V.K. Raina) that the glaciers, have not retreated abnormally. That time we were dismissed saying that it was based on voodoo science. But the new report has clearly vindicated our position,” Ramesh said.Taking a dig at the comments made by Pachauri, who had described the Environment Ministry’s report as “voodoo science,” Ramesh said “now one should know “whodunit.”According to reports, the IPCC claim actually stemmed from a 1999 article in a scientific journal which relied on an estimate made by a glaciologist Syed Iqbal Hasnain and was in no way verified by any members of the climate body.Pachauri said the report of Husnain was published in 1999 when he was not working with him but in the Jawaharlal Nehru University(JNU)."

        "U.S. has no intention to destabilise Rajapaksa Govt: Bogollagama": "Sri Lanka on Friday said it does not give any credence to the 'palpable misinformation’ concerning alleged moves involving the United States, aimed at undermining the leadership of President Rajapaksa, and destabilising his government.A statement put out by the Foreign Ministry said the matter figured when the U.S. Ambassador Ms. Patricia Butenis met Foreign Minister Rohitha Bogollagama.\"Among the matters discussed were reports inimical to the bilateral relationship carried by some sections of the Sri Lanka media. The United States maintains that no room should be left for the creation of impressions that this reportage has any support extended by official sources.\"In response, Minister Bogollagama pointed out the vibrant free media culture prevalent in Sri Lanka which leads to a wide range of reportage. The Foreign Minister further referred to the amity and goodwill inherent in the longstanding Sri Lanka-U.S. bilateral relationship.In this context, the Sri Lanka authorities do not give any credence to the palpable misinformation concerning alleged moves involving the United States, aimed at undermining the leadership of President Rajapaksa, and destabilising his Government.\"The statement went on to quote the Minister as telling the envoy that Colombo valued the economic and political assistance afforded by the U.S. over the past several decades, for the development of the country.The statement by the Ministry on 'palpable misinformation' about the supposed role of the U.S. in the internal affairs of the island nation in sections of the media assumes importance as the charge came from Gotabhaya Rajapaksa, Sri Lanka’s Defence Secretary and brother of the President.In his February 10 interview to the Singapore based Straits Times where he had talked about the alleged coup plans of the former Army Chief retired General Sarath Fonseka he had said, “We are 100 per cent convinced that western countries with vested interests were backing him. Even the U.S., and countries like Norway, spent lots of money on his campaign.\"I have proof of the Norwegian government paying journalists to write against the government. They have vested interests and used to support the Tamil Tigers in various ways. They also supported Fonseka to try oust the President.\"The missions of the U.S. and Norway here had strongly refuted the charges made by the Defence Secretary that they were involved in funding the election campaign of the former Army Chief. \"We would like to point out that the accusations made against Norway in the interview are not correct,\" the Norwegian mission had said in its statement.Meanwhile, the Sri Lanka Election Commission on Friday began accepting nomination papers for candidates intending to contest for the April 8 general elections to elect a new parliament.After the week-long process, the papers would be scrutinised and elections would be held to for 225 seats in the Parliament. Of this, 196 will be voted while the remaining 29 will be appointed from the National List provided by registered parties on the proportional representation basis.According to the Election Commission officials, the independent groups have already begun placing their deposits and till Friday nine independent groups had given their deposits.The mainstream opposition parties have parted ways and are still in the process of firming up their alliances.The UNP has decided to fight under its own election symbol and is wooing several smaller opposition parties that had thrown their weight behind General (retired) Fonseka.So far, Mangala Samaraweera, Sri Lanka Muslim Congress (SLMC) led by Rauff Hakeem and the Democratic People's Front (DPF) led by Mano Ganeshan have agreed to be part of the UNP led alliance.The man, who brought the opposition parties together, General (retired) Fonseka, is expected to lead an alliance floated by the JVP. Fonseka is currently under military detention on a number of charges and there is clarity yet on whether he would be eligible to contest.Nineteen members of Parliament will be elected from Colombo District by 1,521,854 registered voters. The number of MPs elected from the Anuradhapura has been increased by one. Security has been strengthened around District Secretariats during the period as leaders of various Political Parties and Ministers will be frequenting the venues.Officials in the Election Commission further said that it would deploy 300,000 Public Servants for election duty in the forthcoming general election. 250,000 public servants were engaged in election duty during the presidential election.In another development, in a letter addressed to the President, the Tamil United Liberation Front leader, V. Anandasangaree has said that if the government is really serious about restoring democracy at all levels in the North and the East, it should take action, well ahead of the last day for submission of nominations for the forthcoming parliamentary elections, to withdraw all arms from the persons or groups who are not legally authorised to posses arms.\"Then only there will be proper \"Vasantham\" in the North and \"Uthayam\" in the East and the people of these areas will enter into a new-era with most of their rights, be they fundamental, human or democratic, restored fully. Also they will enjoy the freedom of electing their representatives of their own free will. This will not only grant relief for the people after three decades but will also increase the credibility of the government which is at stake at least where the North and the East are concerned”, the letter said."

        "Microsoft speeds up app development with free tools": "Microsoft has opened up a suite of software tools for the international developers, free, for them to write applications and games for its Windows Phone 7 series of mobile devices that are scheduled to go on sale later this year. The move to speed up application development follows a clear global trend, of growing mobile data consumption and flat revenues per phone user.As mobile data use becomes ubiquitous, the market for application software is expanding fast. Applications sales are estimated to be worth $17.5 billion by 2012, up from about $ five billion in 2009. Several phone and software companies are opening up their online marketplace to application developers, who now have the opportunity to write ‘apps' that help users do anything from playing games to accessing social networking sites such as Facebook and Twitter, to booking tickets, tracking flights and listening to music. This they can do for various platforms built by Apple, Google, the upcoming Microsoft Windows Phone 7 series, and others, on different commercial terms.As it prepares for the coming festival season launch of Windows Phone 7 series mobiles, Microsoft recently announced free access to its main developer tools for phones — Visual Studio 2010, Expression Blend 4 and XNA Game Studio 4. The new phone series provides support for the Silverlight framework of Microsoft, which helps to build rich media applications for business and entertainment on computers, the web and on mobile devices.Free access to tools were among the highlights at the MIX 10 conference for the developer community held in Las Vegas, the U.S., between March 15 and 17. The guided approach to application development complements Microsoft's decision to define hardware standards for its Windows Phone 7 series devices to be made by leading vendors. By guaranteeing the specifications of a phone belonging to this series, the customer can be sure of performance levels, company executives say.The minimum features of the devices include a sensitive capacitive touch interface, GPS, accelerometer, compass, five megapixel camera with flash, a camera button, 256 MB memory, eight GB flash storage, directx 9 acceleration, ARMv7 Cortex/Scorpion processor or better.Joe Belfiore, corporate vice-president, Windows Phone, told MIX 10 that the new phone series, strongly woven around social networking behaviour, is designed for a user who is ‘38 years old, 76 per cent employed and 73 per cent in a partnered relationship.” That user profile stands in contrast to the trend of phones aimed primarily at youth. The design specifications are oriented towards users who are described by Microsoft as “life maximisers.”Microsoft hopes that its foray into mobile phones will give it a significant share in the mobile data segment, which is estimated to grow at an annual compounded rate of 131 per cent and mobile voice at 112 per cent over the next three years. By comparison, data access from fixed lines is seen as growing only by 39 per cent CAGR, while fixed line voice use is actually expected to decline by 6 per cent CAGR.Speaking to journalists in Barcelona at the Mobile World Congress, Austen Mulinder, Microsoft's corporate vice-president, worldwide communications sector, pointed out that the number of wireless Internet-connected devices is expected to go up to 10 billion by 2015, up from two billion today. Another metric of interest is the number of users of social networking sites, which currently stands at about 800 million.The factor that will differentiate the smart-phones of the future is data integration — software and programs that connect the personal computer and the mobile phone — and not all providers possess all the pieces here. Music, gaming, search, maps, instant messaging and so on are part of this value set. Aaron Woodman, Microsoft's director of mobile communications, argues that Apple does desktop to mobile integration in the area of music, Nokia offers the service suite Ovi, and Google has search and map services, but in terms of deep integration of all these services with a gaming platform, for example, Microsoft is unique in also possessing the X-Box Live. The mobile small screen is set to witness a lot of action in the coming months."

Scientists have discovered millions of tiny microbes, hitherto unknown to science, at the bottom of the sea.These organisms include microbes of bacteria, worms and ocean insects less than 1mm long.Scientists made the path—breaking discovery using technology such as DNA sequencing, that allows researchers to differentiate between different species, and submarines that can be operated thousands of feet under the sea.A survey was conducted as part of a 10—year international project to find out more about the oceans, the Census of Marine Life.For one study, ocean samples were gathered from over 1,200 sites around the world to find out more about microbial life. It discovered microbes with 18 million different DNA sequences, suggesting the presence of millions of yet unknown species.Another project found 7,000 new genus of bacteria in the Western English Channel alone. Nearly 3,000 types of bacteria were found in a sponge from Australia's Great Barrier Reef.The findings of the survey have led scientists to believe that there could be a billion microbial cells in every litre of seawater.A separate study of holozooplankton, that look like tiny transparent insects, increased the number of known species to 14,000 from 7,000.A study into roundworms found 500,0000 in a single square metre of ocean floor, while currently there are 16,000 known species of seaworms. John Baross of the University of Washington, a contributor to the census, said the findings would open up new doors in science that could help understand changes in the food chain, weather patterns and carbon cycles. “Marine animals alone may account for hundreds of millions microbial species. This is a huge frontier for next decade,” the Telegraph quoted him as saying."

The researchers observed the upper layer (from the surface to 150-200 metres deep with water that enters from the Atlantic), the middle layer (from 200 to 600 metres deep with water from the eastern Mediterranean that enters the western basin via the Strait of Sicily), and the deep layer (from 600 metres to the sea bed with water from the western Mediterranean) of the sea.The team has also observed an increase in the salt level and the temperature of the middle layer of the sea. This has not been clearly observed in the upper layer, “but it can be deduced from the heating of the deep water and from studies done by other teams and our current research projects”, Vargas-Yz states.“We need to support the networks that already exist and build new ones to monitor the sea. Only then will we be able to detect, in a reliable and effective way, the changes taking place in the sea”, Vargas-Yz says. The study is published in the Journal of Geophysical Research."

        "Zuckerberg looks to 1bn Facebook users": "Facebook’s global dominance is almost complete with just Russia, Japan, China and Japan yet to be converted and the social networking giant aiming to reach one billion users, founder Mark Zuckerberg revealed on Wednesday.Zuckerberg also admitted that one day he could see Facebook floating on the stockmarket — just not anytime soon.He added that there was “no chance” Facebook, which has cracked the 500 million user mark, would hit one billion this year but argued that “it is almost a guarantee that it will happen”.“If we succeed [in innovating and remaining relevant] there is a good chance of bringing this to a billion people ... it will be interesting to see how it plays out,” he said speaking to two packed auditoriums — one via video link — at the Cannes Lions International Advertising Festival.Facebook’s global domination is almost complete, he said. “We are down to just four countries where we aren’t the leading social network.” Zuckerberg added that in Russia Facebook had just one million users, the kind of numbers that saw AOL sell off Bebo and ITV relinquish Friends Reunited. But in Facebook’s case, growth is “doubling every six months”, according to Zuckerberg, and Japan and Korea have similar user bases.He said that Facebook can tell when an explosive growth “tipping point” is about to be reached by who is “friending” who. When Facebook first launches in a country, nearly all the friend connections are with foreign Facebook users.“We know that a country has tipped when loca-to-local connections outnumber local to foreign,” he added. “It is a long-term thing [and with regard to the four left to tip] we are probably not going to win in six months, not in a year [but] things look promising in three to five years out.” He also said the company would make an initial public offering. “At some point, sure,” he said. “It is probably not that different [running a public company compared with a privately held one].” However, after many sceptical guffaws in the Cannes audience he backtracked and said: “OK, I’m sure it is a lot different.” Zuckerberg added that one of the issues was that he was in it with a long-term view, which most investors are not if you go public, which he admitted was a “challenge”.He also addressed concerns over privacy, explaining that Facebook’s meteoric growth had meant the company had been caught out while it was in “transition”. However, he added that the changing face of how privacy is perceived now that users are in a digital age meant that there were always going to be “natural tensions”.“Six years ago most people didn’t want any information about themselves on web,” he said. “To start off people were a bit reticent about this. Then over time people think it is great to be connected and share things. I think the world looks a lot different now. There is a real natural tension between people seeing the value of sharing more stuff but wanting control over what they share.” Zuckerberg added that as Facebook developed it built privacy controls for everything. At one point there were more than 100 individual settings users could change, which it had been important to simplify as the company had to “transition [and be] pretty quick to adjust and evolve to 500 million users”.“People have very legitimate questions and it is an important dialogue,” he said."

        "Stem cell biology and its complications": "The renewed debate over embryonic stem cells highlights the advances and complications that have arisen in the field since its controversial beginnings.The cells are a sort of blank slate, plucked from human embryos just a few days after fertilisation. They tantalise scientists because they could in theory turn into any of the body's 200 mature cell types, from blood to brain to liver to heart. They could be used to study and treat diseases and to study the basic biology of what determines a cell's destiny — why a heart cell becomes a heart cell, for example, instead of a brain cell.The problem is their origin — human embryos. In order to get stem cells, embryos must be destroyed. It is this fact that led to the court ruling on Monday blocking most federal financing for embryonic stem cell research.The scientist who isolated human embryonic stem cells in 1998 struggled with this dilemma, consulting ethicists before proceeding. But in the end, the scientist, Dr. James Thomson of the University of Wisconsin, decided to go ahead because the embryos were from fertility clinics and were going to be destroyed anyway. And, he reasoned, the work could greatly benefit humanity.Yet despite the high hopes for embryonic stem cells, progress has been slow — so far there are no treatments with the cells. The Food and Drug Administration just approved the first clinical study, a dose and safety test, of human embryonic stem cells to treat spinal cord injuries.All along, though, scientists wondered if they could sidestep the ethical debate by creating embryonic stem cells without the embryos. Every cell has the same DNA. A heart cell is different from a liver cell because it uses different genes. But all the genes to make a liver cell, or any other cell, are there in the cell. The liver genes are masked in a heart cell and vice versa. Why can't scientists find a way to unmask all of a cell's genes and turn it directly into a stem cell without using an embryo?A few years ago, two groups of researchers — one led by Dr. Thomson — did just that. They discovered that all they had to do was add four genes and a cell would reprogramme itself back to its original state when it was a stem cell in an embryo. Like an embryonic stem cell, that reprogrammed cell seemed to be able to then turn into the many kinds of specialised cells in the body, an ability called pluripotent.What has happened since that discovery, scientists say, is that stem cell biology turned out to be more complicated than they anticipated. Besides the stem cells from embryos, there are so-called adult stem cells found in all tissues but with limited potential because they can only turn into cells from their tissue of origin. And there are these newer cells made by reprogramming mature cells.Now researchers are trying to figure out whether stem cells made by this reprogramming process really are the same as ones taken from embryos. Some say they found subtle differences between these cells, known as induced pluripotent stem cells, or IPSCs, and embryonic stem cells. Others are not so sure.They say they need embryonic stem cells as a basis of comparison, a gold standard to see if the newer reprogrammed cells are as good.“We are not at the stage where you will find many investigators saying, ‘We don't need embryonic stem cells because IP cells are the same',” said Dr. Timothy Kamp, a stem cell researcher and professor of medicine at the University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health. “We don't know that yet.”One complication is that different labs use different methods to obtain the reprogrammed cells and to study them, Dr. Kamp said. As a result, he said, “not all IP cells are the same”.John Gearhart, director of the Institute for Regenerative Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania, and one of the first to isolate human embryonic stem cells, said some investigators ended up with reprogrammed cells “that will have little utility”. They are only partly reprogrammed, he explains.“One worries about how safe and effective they are going to be” if they are ever used in therapies, Mr. Gearhart said.Dr. George Q. Daley, a stem cell researcher at Children's Hospital in Boston, saw subtle differences in a recent study. When he just compared the two types of cells side by side with molecular tests, they looked identical. Then he tried turning them into various types of mature cells and comparing the results. Dr. Daley published a paper in March, in Nature Biotechnology , reporting that mouse IPSCs from different tissues remembered, in a sense, where they came from. He has a similar paper under review showing the same effect with human induced pluripotent stem cells. In the mouse study, it was harder to get pluripotent mouse cells derived from a skin cell, for example, to turn into blood cells than it was to get pluripotent stem cells made from blood cells to turn into blood cells.“They tended to remember their tissue of origin,” Dr. Daley said.Researchers need to find ways to make the cells forget where they came from, he said. Rudolf Jaenisch, a stem cell researcher and biology professor at MIT, said he was not certain there were meaningful differences between human embryonic stem cells and human induced pluripotent cells. But to answer that question will require the use of embryonic stem cells for comparisons, Mr. Jaenisch said. “Things are very much in flux,” he said. “We will probably need human embryonic stem cells for a while. And then we probably will not need them anymore.” — New York Times News Service"

        "Sutil finishes, brings Force India back in the points table": "Adrian Sutil brought Force India back among points after finishing eighth in the action-packed Singapore Grand Prix, the only night race on the Formula One Calendar, here today.It was a mixed day for Force India as Sutil, who started on 16th from the grid, held his nerves to pocket four points from the race in which eight cars including that of Sutil’s teammate Vitantonio Liuzzi crashed out.With this result, Sutil has moved up a place to ninth with 45 points in the drivers’ championship and Force India are placed sixth in the constructors’ championship with 62 points.In the Italian Grand Prix, Force India had returned empty-handed.It is for the third time that Sutil has managed an eighth position with earlier being at Monaco and British Grand Prix.Liuzzi, who began from P17, now has not earned a point in six of the last seven races.Ferrari’s Fernando Alonso won the race from pole position while it was two-three for Red Bull with Sebastian Vettel finishing second and Mark Webber third.Alonso had also won the first night race at the Marina Bay Circuit here in 2008, when he was with Renault.Last year’s winner Lewis Hamilton of McLaren was also among the eight drivers, who crashed out."

        "Sugar production to be 25 million tonnes in 2010-11: Pawar": "Food and Agriculture Minister Sharad Pawar on Wednesday expressed confidence that sugar production in India would touch a record 25 million tonnes in the current sugar year, more than the country’s requirement.“On the sugar front too, the news this year is good with record plantation of sugarcane. I am confident of 250 lakh tonnes of sugar production this sugar year,” Mr. Pawar said at the Economic Editors’ Conference here.For the first time, India will have surplus production of sugar, whereas there is a shortage the world over, he added. The sugar year runs from October to September.Earlier, industry body Indian Sugar Mills Association (ISMA) had also pegged the country’s sugar output at over 25 million tonnes in the 2010-11 crop year.Sugar production in India, the world’s second largest producer and the biggest consumer, was around 19 million tonnes in the sugar year ended September 2010, up from 14 million tonnes in the previous year.Domestic demand for the sweetener in the country is pegged at 23 million tonnes in the current sugar year, which will lead to a situation where the country has surplus sugar output.Mr. Pawar had earlier indicated that the government will consider allowing sugar exports after the Diwali festival, based on the overall demand-supply situation.Although there is no official ban on sugar exports, the Food Ministry has not been giving export permits since 2009.The government recently allowed mills to fulfil their export obligation of about 9,50,000 tonnes by March 2011."

        "Chelsea miss chance to go back to the top": "Chelsea missed the chance to go back to the top of the English Premier League on Sunday when they were held to a 1-1 draw at Newcastle United.Andy Carroll put Newcastle ahead inside the sixth minute and though Salomon Kalou equalised just before half-time, Chelsea could not find a winner.The result leaves Chelsea still two points behind Manchester United in second place, while Newcastle move up to ninth.Having lost their past two games, Chelsea made a horrendous start when Alex tried to pass the ball back to Petr Cech only to watch in horror as his goalkeeper had come off his line to gather.With Cech stranded, Carroll cruised past him to tap the ball into the open goal. Chelsea came into things as the first half progressed and equalised when Kalou’s shot deflected off a defender into the Newcastle goal just before the break.Ashley Cole saved Chelsea when he headed off the line midway through the second-half and Didier Drogba had a goal ruled out for hand-ball.Liverpool losesTottenham Hotspur came from behind to beat Liverpool 2-1 at White Hart Lane and move up to fifth place, with Aaron Lennon scoring the winner in injury-time.Liverpool took the lead at Tottenham when Martin Skrtel stabbed the ball in after a corner was not cleared and Fernando Torres and Maxi Rodriguez then wasted good chances to extend their lead before half-time.Jermain Defoe missed a golden opportunity to equalise when he side-footed a penalty wide after David Ngog blocked a Gareth Bale free kick with his arms.But Tottengham pulled level midway through the second-half when Luka Modric broke down the right and his cross was turned into his own net by the outstretched foot of Skrtel.Spurs chased the winner but at the other end, Raul Meireles smashed a left-foot shot narrowly wide. It looked like it would end in a draw but Peter Crouch flicked on a header to Lennon, who left Paul Konchesky wrong-footed and put the ball past Pepe Reina."

        "Top ten science breakthroughs of the year": " A mechanical device that operates in the quantum realm tops the Science journal's list of advances in 2010.  Until this year, all human-made objects have moved according to the laws of classical mechanics. Back in March, however, a group of researchers designed a gadget that moves in ways that can only be described by quantum mechanics — the set of rules that governs the behaviour of tiny things like molecules, atoms, and subatomic particles. In recognition of the conceptual ground their experiment breaks, the ingenuity behind it and its many potential applications, Science has called this discovery the most significant scientific advance of 2010. Physicists Andrew Cleland and John Martinis from the University of California at Santa Barbara and their colleagues designed the machine—a tiny metal paddle of semiconductor, visible to the naked eye — and coaxed it into dancing with a quantum groove.First, they cooled the paddle until it reached its “ground state,” or the lowest energy state permitted by the laws of quantum mechanics (a goal long-sought by physicists).Then they raised the widget's energy by a single quantum to produce a purely quantum-mechanical state of motion. They even managed to put the gadget in both states at once, so that it literally vibrated a little and a lot at the same time — a bizarre phenomenon allowed by the weird rules of quantum mechanics.Science has recognized this first quantum machine as the 2010 Breakthrough of the Year.  They have also compiled nine other important scientific accomplishments from this past year into a top ten list, appearing in a special news feature in the journal's 17 December 2010 issue. “This year's Breakthrough of the Year represents the first time that scientists have demonstrated quantum effects in the motion of a human-made object,” said Adrian Cho, a news writer for Science . “On a conceptual level that's cool because it extends quantum mechanics into a whole new realm. On a practical level, it opens up a variety of possibilities ranging from new experiments that meld quantum control over light, electrical currents and motion to, perhaps someday, tests of the bounds of quantum mechanics and our sense of reality.” The quantum machine proves that the principles of quantum mechanics can apply to the motion of macroscopic objects, as well as atomic and subatomic particles. It provides the key first step toward gaining complete control over an object's vibrations at the quantum level. Such control over the motion of an engineered device should allow scientists to manipulate those minuscule movements, much as they now control electrical currents and particles of light. In turn, that capability may lead to new devices to control the quantum states of light, ultra-sensitive force detectors and, ultimately, investigations into the bounds of quantum mechanics and our sense of reality. (This last grand goal might be achieved by trying to put a macroscopic object in a state in which it's literally in two slightly different places at the same time — an experiment that might reveal precisely why something as big as a human can't be in two places at the same time.)“Mind you, physicists still haven't achieved a two-places-at-once state with a tiny object like this one,” said Cho. “But now that they have reached the simplest state of quantum motion, it seems a whole lot more obtainable—more like a matter of ‘when' than ‘if.'”The other nineScience's list of the nine other groundbreaking achievements from 2010 follows. Synthetic Biology: In a defining moment for biology and biotechnology, researchers built a synthetic genome and used it to transform the identity of a bacterium. The genome replaced the bacterium's DNA so that it produced a new set of proteins—an achievement that prompted a Congressional hearing on synthetic biology. In the future, researchers envision synthetic genomes that are custom-built to generate biofuels, pharmaceuticals or other useful chemicals. Neandertal Genome: Researchers sequenced the Neandertal genome from the bones of three female Neandertals who lived in Croatia sometime between 38,000 and 44,000 years ago. New methods of sequencing degraded fragments of DNA allowed scientists to make the first direct comparisons between the modern human genome and that of our Neandertal ancestors. HIV Prophylaxis: Two HIV prevention trials of different, novel strategies reported unequivocal success: A vaginal gel that contains the anti-HIV drug tenofovir reduced HIV infections in women by 39 percent and an oral pre-exposure prophylaxis led to 43.8 fewer HIV infections in a group of men and transgender women who have sex with men. Exome Sequencing/Rare Disease Genes: By sequencing just the exons of a genome, or the tiny portion that actually codes for proteins, researchers who study rare inherited diseases caused by a single, flawed gene were able to identify specific mutations underlying at least a dozen diseases. Molecular Dynamics Simulations: Simulating the gyrations that proteins make as they fold has been a combinatorial nightmare. Now, researchers have harnessed the power of one of the world's most powerful computers to track the motions of atoms in a small, folding protein for a length of time 100 times longer than any previous efforts. Quantum Simulator: To describe what they see in the lab, physicists cook up theories based on equations. Those equations can be fiendishly hard to solve. This year, though, researchers found a short-cut by making quantum simulators—artificial crystals in which spots of laser light play the role of ions and atoms trapped in the light stand in for electrons. The devices provide quick answers to theoretical problems in condensed matter physics and they might eventually help solve mysteries such as superconductivity. Next-Generation Genomics: Faster and cheaper sequencing technologies are enabling very large-scale studies of both ancient and modern DNA. The 1,000 Genomes Project, for example, has already identified much of the genome variation that makes us uniquely human—and other projects in the works are set to reveal much more of the genome's function. RNA Reprogramming: Reprogramming cells—turning back their developmental clocks to make them behave like unspecialized \"stem cells\" in an embryo—has become a standard lab technique for studying diseases and development. This year, researchers found a way to do it using synthetic RNA. Compared with previous methods, the new technique is twice as fast, 100 times as efficient and potentially safer for therapeutic use.The Return of the Rat: Mice rule the world of laboratory animals, but for many purposes researchers would rather use rats. Rats are easier to work with and anatomically more similar to human beings; their big drawback is that methods used to make \"knockout mice\"— animals tailored for research by having specific genes precisely disabled—don't work for rats. A flurry of research this year, however, promises to bring \"knockout rats\" to labs in a big way. "

        "Fabregas rescues Arsenal": "Edin Dzeko scored his first goal for Manchester City on Sunday to save them from an embarrassing FA Cup fourth round exit in a 1-1 draw at lower league Notts County.On a heavy pitch at Meadow Lane, the Premier League side struggled to find their rhythm, and fell behind to Neal Bishop’s 59th minute goal.The midfielder got across the near post to meet Alan Gow’s corner, and glanced a header past Joe Hart.But with 10 minutes remaining, Dzeko turned in Micah Richards’s low cross to force a replay.Earlier, Cesc Fabregas came off the bench to score the 2-1 winner over Huddersfield from the penalty spot as Arsenal were pushed to the limit.A Peter Clarke own-goal had given Arsenal the lead when Sebastien Squillaci was sent off for a professional foul. Alan Lee levelled, before Fabregas made it 2-1 with six minutes to go after Bendtner had been tripped.“It was an excellent performance — we passed the ball well and created chances,” said Huddersfield manager Lee Clark.“We limited Arsenal, which is not easy coming here, and the lads have worked extremely well so that in context we are disappointed we did not get anything more from the game Arsenal’s day was soured by a groin injury sustained by Samir Nasri.“Nasri looks to have a serious hamstring injury,” said Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger.“Usually it is three weeks. We have to see if it is a grade one; it will be two weeks, so we will see. I have now regrets because the plan was to play Rosicky, but he was still too weak because he was sick, so I took the gamble on Nasri.”"

        "Don't ban Great Soul": " Union Law Minister Veerappa Moily's announcement that the central government would ban the book Great Soul: Mahatma Gandhi and his Struggle with India had no justification in fact, law, or common sense. The threatened ban on the book — the contents of which Mr. Moily dramatically described as “heresy” — was based, at best, on a total misreading of it and, at worst, on no-reading but relying on grossly misleading reviews in a section of the western media. The biography, written by Joseph Lelyveld, a former editor of the New York Times , does not claim that Mahatma Gandhi was bi-sexual; neither does it portray him as a racist. In the course of a serious exploration that traces the links between the beginning of Gandhi's political life in South Africa and its development in India, the book refers to his close relationship with East Prussian architect Hermann Kallenbach. The strong emotional bond between the two, who lived together for a while on Tolstoy Farm near Johannesburg, is more than borne out by the letters Gandhiji wrote to Kallenbach. Mr. Lelyveld quotes a Gandhi scholar in the book as characterising their relationship as “homoerotic” rather than “homosexual,” an interpretation one is free to dispute. But surely, that cannot be a basis for banning a book as the Gujarat government has done with great alacrity and the Government of India was seriously considering until Mr. Moily did an about-turn on the issue.  “I am of the earth, earthy … I am prone to as many weaknesses as you are,” the Mahatma famously declared. He explored a number of these weaknesses with extraordinary honesty in My Experiments with Truth . Most publishers love, and some even stage-manage, the kind of controversy that has broken out over what is a small section of a chapter in Mr. Lelyveld's biography. Not so long ago, in grandson Rajmohan Gandhi's Mohandas , a small episode in the Mahatma's life — his relationship with Rabindranath Tagore's niece Saraladevi Chaudharani (“around which Eros too might have lurked”) — became the frenzied focus of the media. Section 95 of the Code of Criminal Procedure empowers authorities to proscribe books if they contain material that breaches the peace or causes communal tension. Surely, it is no one's case that Great Soul does that. The Supreme Court, which has consistently opposed crude attempts at censorship, has severely limited the use of Section 95 to proscribe books. From a quick reading of the controversial references in the Kindle edition, it seems that Mr. Lelyveld has made too much of what is essentially thin source material on the subject. The answer to that is reasoned, informed criticism. The Mahatma would have been the first to protest against any suggestion of an obscurantist ban. "

        "India to strengthen middle-order ahead of World Cup": "Sachin Tendulkar holds every conceivable cricket record in an illustrious career spanning over two decades, and the only thing missing from his portfolio is the World Cup. He makes no secret that he wants to be part of a victorious India team, playing in his record sixth and probably the last World Cup this spring.Tendulkar came close to fulfilling his dream in 2003, before Australia shattered it in South Africa in the final.“I still want to achieve something and everyone knows what it is,” he said in the run-up to the third World Cup in the subcontinent.Tendulkar’s teammates are also hunger for the World Cup. Their refrain is that they should do it for the 37-year-old maestro, their hero. Along with them, a billion people hope their 28-year wait for the World Cup a second time will finally end now.Indians realise that hopes alone cannot deliver the ultimate victory. Clubbed with the Cup aspirants South Africa and England, two-time champions West Indies, Bangladesh, Ireland and the Netherlands, the world No.2 ODI team’s main challenge is to absorb the pressure of playing before the home crowd.To compound their problems, the Indians play their opening match of the tournament Feb 19 against Bangladesh and that, too, in their backyard Dhaka.It was the shocking defeat at the hands of Bangladesh in the preliminaries that literally knocked India out of the last World Cup in the Caribbean. Sri Lanka, the third team in the group, then went through to the final.While the Indians try to live down that memory and the tag of favourites, the other contenders see them as the team they need to beat to win the Cup.India’s strength is their batting, a line-up that has Tendulkar, Virender Sehwag, Gautam Gambhir and skipper Mahendra Singh Dhoni — all masters of the willow — and their bowling, too, is in the capable hands of Zaheer Khan and Harbhajan Singh.In 1987 and 1996 when the subcontinent hosted the event, India could not make the semi-final, losing in the penultimate match.This time around, India look better prepared under South African coach Gary Kirsten, who has escorted them to the top of the Test rankings. But can they continue their good form into the World Cup?Though the middle order has caused some concern as it failed to deliver in the ODIs in South Africa, skipper Mahendra Singh Dhoni is confident that his team will peak by the time the first ball of the World Cup is bowled.“The South Africa series was a disappointing series for the batsmen. Bowlers were getting the wickets and the runs too. Overall, we haven’t performed as a batting unit. But we will be better prepared for the World Cup,” Dhoni said.The bowlers are in good form and the experience of Zaheer and Harbahajan will be the key. Zaheer, Harbahajan and Ashish Nehra were part of the team that made the 2003 final, and the team will rely heavily on the trio this time as well.However, the key is the performance of the bits and pieces players. Yuvraj Singh, Suresh Raina, Yusuf Pathan, Piyush Chawla and Ravichandran Ashwin will all have to double up to make sizable contributions if the team has to click.Sehwag, Yuvraj and Pathan will be the game changers.Squad: Mahendra Singh Dhoni (captain/wicketkeeper), Sachin Tendulkar, Virender Sehwag, Gautam Gambhir, Yuvraj Singh, Suresh Raina, Virat Kohli, Yusuf Pathan, Ravichandran Ashwin, Harbhajan Singh, Piyush Chawla, Praveen Kumar, Zaheer Khan, Munaf Patel and Ashish Nehra Fixtures: Feb 19 vs. Bangladesh (Dhaka); Feb 27 vs. England (Bangalore); March 6 vs. Ireland (Bangalore); March 9 vs. the Netherlands (Delhi); March 12 vs. South Africa (Nagpur); March 20 vs. West Indies (Chennai) "

We had discussed that extensively in a number of meetings in the White House and with the (U.S.) President,” John Brennan, National Security Advisor for Counterterrorism and Homeland, told reporters at White House.Bin Laden was killed in a pre-dawn operation on Monday in Pakistan’s Abbottabad, 120 km from Islamabad.“The concern was that bin Laden would oppose any type of capture operation. Indeed, he did.“There was a fire fight. He therefore was killed in that fire fight, and that’s when the remains were removed. But we certainly were planning for the possibility, which we thought was going to be remote, given that he would he likely resist arrest but that we would be able to capture him,” he said.The White House official said they were trying ensure that mission was accomplished safely.“We were not going to put our people at risk. The president put a premium on making sure that our personnel were protected, and we were not going to give bin Laden or any of his cohorts the opportunity to carry out lethal fire on our forces.“He was engaged, and he was killed in the process. But if we had the opportunity to take him alive, we would have done that,” he said.Mr. Brennan said Osama bin Laden was engaged in a fire fight with those entered the house.“Whether or not he got off any rounds, I’d quite frankly don’t know,” he said.Mr. Brennan said the course of action and the subsequent decisions have been made over the course of the last several months.“There was a working group that was working this on a regular basis, if not a daily basis, over the last several weeks, looking at every decision and based on what type of scenario would unfold, what actions and decisions would be made,” the official said.“It was looked at from the standpoint of, if we captured him, what would we do with him, where would he go. If he was killed, what would we do with him and where would he go?” he added."

And despite dropping her serve for the only time late in the second set, Li won the final nine points of the match to earn her first major title.On Sunday, five—time champion Rafael Nadal will face Roger Federer in the men’s final.The title was only Li’s fifth in her career, and first on clay.She was broken only once by the defending champion, while she converted two of her eight break points - one in each set. She finished with 31 winners, while Schiavone had only 12.Li took a 3—2 lead in the first when Schiavone sent a forehand wide. She held at love in the next two games, and then won the set when Schiavone sent a forehand long.The Chinese player opened the second set with her second break of the match, and then saved Schiavone’s first break point in the next game with an ace. But Schiavone broke back in the eighth game to even the score at 4—4.Both players held the rest of the way, but Schiavone came within two points of winning the set on five occasions, three times at 5—5 and two more at 6—6.Although Li has said she is not a big fan of playing on clay, her power and precision worked well against Schiavone, who last year became the first Italian woman to win a Grand Slam singles title.For Li, the year started well but soon took a dip.After losing to Kim Clijsters in the Australian Open final, the 29—year—old Li lost her next four matches. But she recovered her form shortly before the French Open, reaching the semifinals in Madrid.By winning Saturday, Li is expected to jump to No. 4 in the women’s rankings, equaling the record for the highest ranking by a woman from Asia. Japanese player Kimiko Date—Krumm has also been ranked No. 4.Both Li and Schiavone came into the final with plenty of experience. Combined, they were the oldest pair in a women’s Grand Slam final since Wimbledon in 1998, when Jana Novotna, 29, beat Nathalie Tauziat, 30."

        "AC Milan lifts Supercup": "Zlatan Ibrahimovic and Kevin-Prince Boateng reversed Wesley Sneijder’s opener in AC Milan’s 2-1 defeat of Inter Milan Saturday in the Italian Supercup tie played in Beijing.The Serie A champions had a sluggish start before the 80,000 fans filling the Bird’s nest stadium and fell behind on a free kick from the Dutch sharpshooter, but secured the win with a furious second half.Milan’s sixth Supercup victory sees them move one ahead of city rivals Inter in the all-time rankings.Under new coach Gian Piero Gasperini, Inter hardly suffered in the first half from the absences of Brazil defenders Maicon and Lucio, while Argentine players Esteban Cambiasso and striker Diego Milito were also allowed a rest after July’s Copa America.Milan did little early in the game, save a missed shot from Robinho after a pass-and-go with Ibrahimovic, before falling behind on Sneijder’s majestic shot.After a high drive from Dejan Stankovic, the Dutchman on 22 minutes stunned Christian Abbiati by the closest post with a swerving free kick from the top-left corner of the box.Inter’s Argentine newcomer Ricardo Alvarez aimed high on 35 minutes and Samuel Eto’o tried from a tight angle as the Nerazzurri contained the Devils’ equalizing efforts with Gasperini’s three-man defence closely supported by the midfield.Ibra, however, had a great chance on 40 minutes, but nodded against the post off a cross from Ignazio Abate from the right flank.Milan veteran Clarence Seedorf and his compatriot Sneijder fired high early in the second half as Milan pressed for an equalizer that Ibra nodded home on the hour.A hammering action allowed Robinho to set up Seedorf on the right for a precise cross that the Swede deflected into the empty net.Massimiliano Allegri brought on striker Pato for his Brazil compatriot Robinho as Milan kept up a brisk pace and reversed on 69 minutes with Boateng’s flick after a great effort from Pato.Julio Cesar only managed to slap his compatriot’s firm shot against the post and was helpless as the Ghanaian Boateng slid to deflect.Striker Giampaolo Pazzini came on for Stankovic, but Inter failed to create telling troubles for the Devils’ defence.“We knew it was a hard game,” Allegri said. “It was a derby and it was not easy to start the season with a game like this. We did not start well. In the second half we played better, with more courage.” The Chinese capital is to host two more editions of the trophy by 2014, following a deal worth about 10 million euros (14.3 million dollars) with the Serie A football league."

        "‘I was brash, immature'": " Randeep Hooda is basking in the response he's been receiving for his performance in the gritty Saheb Biwi aur Gangster . That Randeep is a thinking actor is a known fact. It's also known that he has the knack of making unusual choices.  Box office successes, though, have been few and far between. He did get noticed in Once Upon a Time in Mumbaai but had to share the honours with the lead actors. With SBG , does he feel that he is getting his due, finally? “I would sound boastful if I were to say that the world owes me this,” laughs the actor. “I don't think on those lines. But yes, a pat on the back goes a long way for an actor. It is very encouraging and I shall try my best to build on the faith that people have on me,” he says.  The industry has been a rough ride for someone who was considered the find of the year when Ram Gopal Verma re-launched him in D in 2005, four years after he charmed his way as a supporting actor in Monsoon Wedding . “I was the blue-eyed boy. But I was also brash, immature and young. I think I am slightly better off now,” he grins, taking stock of the years that followed. “With time, I understood that audience will not come in hordes to watch me just because I can emote well in front of the camera. Filmmaking is a team effort and a lot of things come into play.” When things were tough, he took a break and came back stronger.Talk to him about his unusual choice of films and he quips, “I haven't been the biggest champion of choices. Some of the film I turned down went on to become big hits. Had I accepted them, they would have cemented my place in the industry. A few other films that I worked on didn't work out as I had imagined them to. Earlier, I made my choices based on the role and not the script, which I learnt is not sensible. A film works primarily because of the script. Secondly, the director and the team can make a film work. Next comes the role,” he explains. He is happy that there's space for films like Saheb Biwi aur Gangster . “The industry is waking up to new ideas and new forms of storytelling and the audience is enjoying it. I think people have always been intelligent. It's like walking into a bookstore where people get to choose from different genres and authors. Give people greater choice and they will accept different kinds of films,” he says.  Coming up next is Rang Rasiya , a film that was originally expected to release in 2008. “This isn't the first time a film of mine has been delayed, due to various reasons. At least four or five films have had a similar fate. I hope it doesn't happen to any actor. When a film is delayed for years, it loses its freshness. Whether it is tangible at the box office or not, only when a film releases you get to know the audience reactions to the script and the performance,” he says.  Randeep will soon begin shooting for Jannat 2 and is excited about the second edition of the highly successful first film produced by the Bhatts. "

        "Sonia’s speech triggers Cong-BJP slugfest": "Congress president Sonia Gandhi’s speech in Uttarkhand on Wednesday, which made a veiled attack on Team Anna, sparks a political slugfest between Congress and BJP over the issue of corruption.While BJP accused the UPA Chairperson of being equally responsible for the “inaction” against corruption in government, Congress said the opposition party has no moral right to talk about corruption.“It is surprising that BJP talks about corruption. Whenever Congress and the government felt there was slightest indication of corruption, action was taken even before the courts held any body guilty,” Congress spokesperson Rashid Alvi told reporters in New Delhi.He also raked up the corruption issues involving former Karnataka Chief Minister B.S. Yeddyurapa, former party President Bangaru Laxman and former party MP Dilip Singh Judev.“Advani says he tried to convince former Karnataka Chief Minister B.S. Yeddyurappa but he does not detail what he tried to convince him. Then why Advani remained silent,” Mr. Alvi said.BJP spokesperson Shahnawaz Hussain said “the UPA Chairperson has said in her speech at a programme in Uttarakhand that mere public speeches will not end corruption. I think she has read out our statement. We have been saying for long that corruption is not going to end by speeches”.“The hands of both the UPA-I and UPA-II governments are soiled in corruption,” he added.Mr. Alvi dismissed BJP’s criticism of UPA government on price rise issue saying there was no let-up in the same during NDA rule but added that Congress wants the government to take steps to bring down prices as soon as possible and is hopeful it will happen before long."

        "UNFORGETTABLE - Dev kahan ho": "I am just a year senior to Dev Anand. All three of us, Raj, Dev and I, started our careers around the same time in the mid-1940s. I still have fond memories of Dev and I travelling by local train to look for work in various studios. We developed a good rapport within a short period and Dev became a dear family friend, especially of my younger brother, Nasir Khan.  By the late 1940s all of us were able to gain a strong footing in filmdom. Raj and I achieved stardom with “Shaheed”, “Andaz” and “Barsat”. Dev rose to heights with “Ziddi” and “Baazi”. We shared a decent professional rapport and a mutual set of unspoken ethics right from the beginning. Though nothing was put into words, we shared a silent regard for each other. There were frequent meetings between us when we would discuss and analyse each of our works. We had humorous moments also when Raj would imitate me and Dev immaculately. They were such beautiful moments as we were competitors, not rivals. Dev's plus point was that he was very cooperative with every co-star and technician. He had devastating looks and a smile which till date no other actor has. Whenever he received the right script and an imaginative director, he gave superb performances as in “Kala Pani”, “Asli Naqli” and “Guide”. Among us, he was the best in performing romantic scenes.  I had the good fortune of sharing space on screen with Dev Anand in Gemini's “Insaniyat” in 1955. Directed by the respected S.S. Vasan, it was a costume drama. So generous was Dev that he cancelled dates of his own production shooting to accommodate dates with me. I personally saw how he helped junior artists by giving them take after take so that they could prove their worth. He never neglected anyone.  We made it a point to attend each other's family functions. I attended his sister's marriage in the mid- 1950s and daughter Devina's marriage in 1985. Dev was present with wife Mona throughout my marriage function with Saira Banu in 1966 and also other events at our Pali Hill residence. We met like family members and never did our profession come into our relations.  Perhaps the most important visit, I, Raj and Dev did was to see Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru, then India's Prime Minister, prior to his demise. We discussed many issues together. Just as I addressed him as Dev, he addressed me as Lale. I am shocked and grief struck to learn about his sad demise in London suddenly. My 89 birthday will be my saddest one as I will miss my dear Dev who I am sure would come, hug and greet me saying, “ Lale, Tu Hazar Saal Jiyega .” Dev, Kahan Chale Gaye Mujhe Chod Ke . "

        "The ties that bind": " You can understand why some films of iffy quality find a place at a festival. Like the Coen Brothers’ Hail, Caesar! , which I missed due to a late flight into Berlin. But everyone said it was nothing special — at least, nothing special enough to open such a major international festival. But not every film can be about pushing the boundaries of cinematic art, like Lav Diaz’s 8 hour 2 minute drama, A Lullaby to the Sorrowful Mystery . A festival needs stars and glamour, and big, splashy Hollywood releases have to be there. But what explains the inclusion in competition (which means it’s a contender for the festival’s top prize, the Golden Bear) of the Arabic drama Inhebbek Hedi , directed by Mohamed Ben Attia? This is the story of a young Tunisian named Hedi (Majd Mastoura), who works as a sales agent for Peugeot. The first scene shows him stuck in traffic, knotting his tie in his car (translation: he’s suffocating), as a single piano key is struck repeatedly (translation: something ominous is about to happen). It isn’t a good sign when we begin with clichés, which keep piling up. He’s entering into an arranged marriage with Khedija (Omnia Ben Ghali), who’s so demure she’ll only meet him in his car, and even after three years of being engaged, she shrinks back when he attempts to kiss her. Is it any surprise he’s drawn to the free-spirited Rym (Rym Ben Messaoud), who entertains tourists with Hawaiian dances? To make things clearer, Rym, unlike Khedija, lives by the sea — she’s locked in neither by land, nor by the customs and traditions of the land.There are hints that this isn’t just a love triangle, that something larger is at play. The country is in a crisis. Rym wants to move to France. Hedi’s brother Ahmed (Hakim Boumsaoudi) is there too, working as an engineer. But even there, life is tough for immigrants. The festival brochure tries to sell the film this way: “An ostensibly personal story broadens into a panorama of a society in upheaval, an allegory about breaking away from traditions. And a film about happiness and pain of freedom.” But the story is familiar to anyone who watches Hollywood films. Or even the recent Indian multiplex films, many of which are about people trapped between the opposing pulls of tradition and freedom. At many points, I felt I was watching an Indian film. “He’ll always be my little boy,” says Hedi’s mother. And later, when she learns he may not be marrying Khedija after all, she wails, “After all we have done for you.” There’s talk of dowry and the inability to settle down someplace too far away from one’s parents, and Ahmed – the film’s most interesting character – is like many NRIs who cannot (or will not) return home and yet want to control what’s happening at home. He’s keen on the Hedi–Khedija weding because he wants to get into business with her father. Inhebbek Hedi is a nice film, and at times affecting, but is “nice’ enough to compete for one of the most prestigious film awards in the world? With the racism row heating up, thanks to the Oscars, it’s impossible not to wonder if films like Hedi are selected simply so that the competition line-up has some diversity. Hedi , undoubtedly, is a window to another world, one where women wear head scarves and yet smoke cigarettes, where the sounds of ululating at rituals mingle with the sounds of pre-marital lovemaking. But can this alone be enough? But without this diversity, I suppose festival organisers will throw themselves open to questions about racism, especially with the refugee crisis in Europe. At the end, even if I didn’t feel my mind had expanded, I found that my heart had swelled a bit, for we’ve all been through some version of Hedi’s dilemma. As much as we want to break free, some ties are too strong."

        "Theri film review: This man is from Mass": " So we wait for the hero-introduction scene. Maybe he’ll smash through a wall and land a punch on a villain who is extorting money from slum-folk. Maybe he’ll ride in on a bike, in slo-mo, the scene lasting long enough for fans to expend all the wind in their lungs through wolf-whistles. But no. When we first meet Joseph Kuruvilla (Vijay) in Theri, directed by Atlee, he’s bent behind his bike, fixing it. Beside him, his daughter Nivi (Nainika) stamps her foot impatiently. Then, a car speeds past a puddle nearby, and the water splashes on her. This is it, we think. Joseph Kuruvilla’s face will appear. He’ll give chase. He’ll break the driver’s bones. Or at least leave an impression of his fingerprints on the driver’s cheek. We get the face. We get the chase. And we get a tame finish, with the driver being asked to apologise. What the… Instantly, we know the story. Any film in which a mass hero is a mouse in the early reels will feature a flashback in which we see him as a tiger, and then a second flashback in which we see why this tiger transformed into a mouse. Atlee’s screenplay checks all the boxes, and we’re checking these boxes ten minutes ahead of him. But that’s not the problem. We don’t go to these movies expecting finely etched narrative arcs and convincing characters. But we let all of this pass because what we look for are the mass moments, the moments that creep past the logic centres in the brain and affect us almost atavistically. Like the one in which several goons are taught a lesson in a third-standard classroom. Like the bit with Vijay dancing to a Dhanush song. Like the interval moment at the bridge. Like the moment where a just-orphaned kid takes a Five Star bar out of his pocket. And I’m sure the legions of Atlee’s young fans, the ones who fell hard for his earlier film Raja Rani, are going to make screensavers of this line: Love solla vekka padaravan vaazhave vekka padaravan . But there aren’t enough of these moments for such a long, predictable movie that keeps reminding you of Chatriyan and Baasha and Ramana and a hundred other tiger-turned-mouse-turned-tiger sagas. Even the questions that run through our heads are predictable. With all the money at their disposal, why aren’t the action scenes better? How long are we going to keep countering dishoom with dishoom? Where are the nail-biting thrills in the stretch where a school bus filled with kids veers off into a river? Why are GV Prakash’s songs so unmemorable, and when are they going to find a choreographer who can really do justice to Vijay’s extraordinary dancing abilities? The casting of the great director Mahendran as the antagonist sounds great in theory, but why is the character so ineffective? What are the Censor’s Board’s criteria for awarding a U certificate? This film has a line where a forensic examiner speaks of rapists eradicating traces of semen by violating the victim with a rusty iron rod. There’s a scene where a gun hovers over an infant’s head. Men are found with their genitals lopped off? Which part of all this screams “this is a movie for the entire family”? At least the question of why there isn’t much comedy finds an easy answer. Once you cast Amy Jackson as a schoolteacher in a small town in Kerala, the laughs come automatically. At one point, she asks Joseph, “ Malayalam theriyadha ?” Lady, you can barely get by in Tamil, and now we have to buy you as a specialist in the southern languages?  Vijay works best in the light-comic zone of a Thuppaki or a Puli , and he totally sells the scene where he charms the family of the girl he loves (Samantha). But Atlee keeps nudging the actor into heavy-duty dramatic zones, with an eye on the section of the audience we like to call thaaikulam. (If P Vasu made an action movie, it’d feel like Theri .) The hero sheds tears of sorrow for the rape victim. He sheds tears of joy when his little girl is born. He loves loves loves his mother (Radhika, in one of the most grab-the-cheque-and-run roles of her career). I’m not saying you cannot find a place for these sentiments in a mass-hero movie, but the film ends up schizophrenic trying to balance them with the more macho stuff the actor’s fans want. So after all those tears, we end up with the hero as the ghost who walks, a phantom who appears out of nowhere to dole out justice. Someone like Netaji, we’re told, whose death remains unverified and who could be doing the kind of villain-dispatching the hero does here. In Kollywood, it’s just a little leap from INA to WTH."

Ebola virus was detected in 10 specimens taken from eight men, for up to 9 months after recovery.In addition, researchers showed that the persistence of the virus in semen decreases with time - the virus, present in 28.5 per cent of samples taken between the first and third months, was subsequently detected in only 16 per cent between the fourth and sixth months, in 6.5 per cent between the seventh and ninth months, 3.5 per cent between the tenth and 12th months, and finally 0 per cent after 12 months.The results confirm the findings published last year in the New England Journal of Medicine on a cohort of survivors in Sierra Leone.Researchers emphasised the need to recommend, at an international level, the use of condoms by survivors in the months following their recovery.They also insisted on the importance of developing survivor monitoring, or even making it systematic, in order to limit the risks of a recrudescence of the epidemic.The findings were published in the Journal of Infectious Diseases."

Ireland shock Ukraine in Euro 2016": "Northern Ireland shocked Ukraine 2-0 in Euro 2016 Group C on Thursday thanks to goals from Gareth McAuley and Niall McGinn to keep alive their hopes of reaching the knockout phase at Euro 2016.A flying header from veteran West Bromwich Albion defender McAuley and McGinn's injury-time strike at a hailstone-battered Stade de Lyon gave Ireland their first ever goals at a European championships finals.Having recovered after losing their Euro 2016 opener 1-0 to Poland, Michael O'Neill's Irish now have everything to play for against world champions Germany in their final group game on Tuesday.McAuley also wrote himself into the history books.The Ukrainians must now beat Poland in Marseille next Tuesday, and hope the Irish lose heavily to Germany, to have any chance of progressing. The Green Army will now make their way to Paris' Parc de Prince buoyed before they face Joachim Loew's Germany.Highlights:»The Northern Irish manager made five changes from his starting line-up after his side had failed to impose themselves on Poland, including dropping top scorer Kyle Lafferty. O'Neill preferred to start QPR's Conor Washington as striker instead of Norwich City's Lafferty who had netted seven goals in qualifying to help the Irish reach the finals. Ukraine coach Mykhailo Fomenko kept faith with the majority of the side which lost 2-0 to Germany last Sunday.»It was an impressive display from Northern Ireland, who fought their way back into the game. They had struggled for first-half possession -- winning just 35 percent in the first 45 minutes.»And the first clear chance for either side came with half an hour gone when Irish centre-back Craig Cathcart headed over.»Mother Nature played her part as the heavens opened over the Stade de Lyon for the start of the second-half. It did little to hinder McAuley's diving header looping over Ukraine goalkeeper Andriy Pyatov in a torrential downpour after a brilliant cross from Oliver Norwood on 49 minutes.»The greasy ball was nearly in the Irish net minutes later as their goalkeeper Michael McGovern twice humbled, then gathered, half chances from Taras Stepanenko, then Yevhen Konoplyanka.»Both teams struggled in the sodden conditions as a hail storm then battered the pitch and on 58 minutes Czech referee Pavel Kralovec decided enough was enough as he halted the game.»The players were back out three minutes later and Ukraine fought for the equaliser as Viktor Kovalenko fired wide of McGovern with 20 minutes left.»Ukraine peppered their opponents' goal with long-range shots before McGinn slammed in just before the end to wrap up a famous win for his side."

        "The Kalam effect": "After Jawaharlal Nehru, if any public personality has made an impact on the consciousness of the children of the country, it is APJ Abdul Kalam. Scholastic India recently released under its Great Lives series the biography of the people’s President whose first death anniversary falls this month. With text by Shamim Padamsee and art by Lavanya Karthik, the book follows the remarkable journey of the man who ignited minds, bringing to fore his perseverance, hard work and exemplary vision which won him the hearts of millions of Indians.Describing him as a selfless leader who had the welfare of the nation close to his heart, Padamsee says she felt inspired while researching for the book.Excerpts:What was the catalyst?The man himself! Coming from a humble background, and that too from small-town India, he was able to rise above the many hurdles with steadfastness and a strong sense of purpose. He never hesitated to reach for the stars yet had his feet firmly planted on the ground.Tell us about the research you did for the bookDr. Kalam's life was replete with challenges of all kinds. The more I read about him, the more I wanted to read. I read his autobiographical works, his speeches, as well as, articles about him. Luckily for me as the President of India, there was no dearth of material on his life. The challenge was not on where to find material about him rather it was on making decisions on what to leave out. As it was a book for children, I did not want it to be too data-heavy. Children generally do not read biographies, unless it is mandated by schools. I wanted to create in them a love for reading the biographies of great people –– their struggles, and how they achieved success. Hence, the book had to have just the right amount of information to grab their attention. Hoping that what they read would pique their interest and make them want to find out more, I kept the style of narration more anecdotal rather than sequential.Tell us about the use of quasi-graphic style in the biography.I think the concept is brilliant. When Tina Narang, my editor, mooted the idea I was utterly delighted. As I mentioned biographies are generally shunned by children and this was a great way of showcasing one with that was visually appealing, with the appropriate amount of text to whet their appetite.While writing the book did you discover or imbibe some of his traits?His never-say-die attitude. He had an amazing confidence that he would find the solutions to seemingly impossible tasks and his caring for one and all. His first assignment at the Defence Research Development Organisation was to create a hovercraft. He looked around for design solutions and found none –– neither through books nor experts in the field. Everywhere he searched he reached a dead-end street (this was pre-search engine days). He could have abandoned the project but he wasn’t one to give up easily. He said the Wright Brothers were bicycle mechanics and if they could come up with a blueprint for an aircraft that could actually fly, how difficult would it be for them to create a hovercraft? And he went on to design one that worked.Another thing which I learnt, though not mentioned in the book, is that when the compound wall was being built for the Indian Space Research Organisation, Hyderabad, the plan was to embed broken glass pieces to keep intruders away. Kalam vetoed the idea, for he was concerned that birds that perched on it would injure themselves.When his term as the President was getting over, someone aware of his love for the Mughal Gardens asked him if he would miss it. He said although he would soon be leaving the Gardens, they would stay in a special corner of his heart. He added that one should not be so greedy as to want to enjoy it for a longer time as it was time to let someone else have the pleasure.What are your thoughts about the Great Lives series?Most of the well-written biographies accessed by Indian children are from other nations. They can easily rattle off a string of Western scientists, artists and writers. How many of the luminaries of the Indian sub-continent do they know? Hence, this timely series fills in that gap beautifully. When children read it they will realise that a lot of good work has happened and is happening all around the country and will feel a sense of pride in our nation. Here I would like cite an example of mismatched learning. Once with a youngster in tow, I attended a workshop being conducted at the National Gallery of Modern Art. Under the roof housing the great Indian masters –– Raza, Sabavala, Padamsee, Souza and Anjolie Ela Menon among others, the resource person only talked about the salient features of the European artists, Van Gogh, Monet and others!"

Spain's Carolina Marin beat her 21-19, 21-12, 21-15 at the badminton final on Thursday. She has come a long way — from a 16-year-old watching Saina Nehwal win the 2012 London Olympics bronze to being India's lone badminton medal hope in the 2016 Games.Prior to the Games, she said, \"The biggest dream I am chasing now is an Olympic medal. I remember watching Saina in London. Then I was ranked World No. 25. I always longed to be there and I am all excited to represent India in Rio.” She broke into the Top 20 in 2012, and is currently ranked no. 10 in the world.Sindhu scripted a stellar 22-20, 21-19 win against former World No. 1 and London Games silver medallist Wang Yihan to enter the women’s semifinals. Her fierce strokeplay and aggressive cross-court returns have been the highlights of her game so far. She rated her win over the London Olympics silver medallist as one of the best moments of her career.The bigger rewardShe first made her mark in the badminton circles in 2013. She won her maiden grand prix gold at the Malaysian Open, went on to win the first of her hat-trick of titles at the Macau Open. The bigger reward in the form of Arjuna award was the icing on the cake.With former volleyball players for parents — her father Ramanna is an Arjuna awardee — it is only natural that sports had always been her calling. But why badminton? Inspired by her iconic mentor, Pullela Gopichand’s exploits on court, she started wielding the racquet at the age of eight. She was awarded the FICCI Breakthrough Sportsperson of the Year in 2014 and NDTV Indian of the Year 2014, the year in which she won her second consecutive medal at the World Championships.In March 2015, P.V. Sindhu became the youngest recipient of the Padma Shri, India’s fourth highest civilian honour.She is the second-highest-ranked women’s singles player from India after Olympic bronze medalist and No. 2 Saina Nehwal. With a methodical style of play, considered to be defensive — building up with long rallies to lay seize to a point as and when an opening arises, she has evolved remarkably well to streamline her method towards winning. At the same time, she has recently added a more aggressive facet to her game, being more vociferous and playing attacking shots that put the opponent on the backfoot. >More...Watch Sindhu's family rejoice her win."

        "'Game of Thrones,' 'Veep' take top honors at Emmys": "Game of Thrones conquered the Emmy kingdom Sunday, honoured as top drama for the second consecutive year and becoming the most honoured prime-time TV series ever on a night of surprises and sharp political jabs. Veep repeated as best comedy series and its star, Julia-Louis Dreyfus, won a record-breaking sixth Emmy as best comedy actress. Jeffrey Tambor’s trophy as top comedy actor for Transparent also was his second.  But the top drama acting trophies were far from predictable — Rami Malek of Mr. Robot and Tatiana Maslany of Orphan Black were the winners, both overcoming heavyweight competition. “Oh, my God. Please tell me you’re seeing this too,” said a stunned Malek, who plays an emotionally troubled engineer caught up in a dangerous hacking conspiracy. Games of Thrones , the fantasy saga based on George R.R. Martin’s novels, received a total of 12 awards on Sunday and at last weekend’s technical arts ceremony for a cumulative 38, besting Frasier by one to claim most prime-time series awards ever.  The Emmys proved more adroit than the Oscars at recognising and honoring diversity in Hollywood’s top ranks, with trophies going to minority actors and behind-the-scenes artists including writers Aziz Ansari and Alan Yang of Master of None .  But Viola Davis of How to Get Away with Murder failed to repeat her 2015 best drama actress win, the first for a woman of color. Louis-Dreyfus used her victory to take a dig at GOP contender Donald Trump in a ceremony loaded with election-year asides. A shaking Louis-Dreyfus ended her speech by dedicating the trophy to her father, who she said died Friday. Before that, she honed in on GOP contender Donald Trump’s campaign.  “I’d also like to take this opportunity to personally apologize for the current political climate,” she said. “I think that Veep has torn down the wall between comedy and politics. Our show started out as a political satire but it now feels more like a sobering documentary.” She promised to “rebuild that wall and make Mexico pay for it.”  Maggie Smith was honored as best supporting actress in a drama series for the final season of Downton Abbey . It was her third win for playing the formidable dowager. As has become her custom, she didn’t attend the ceremony. And after Smith’s win, Kimmel said her Emmy would not be mailed to her but would be kept in the Microsoft Theater’s Lost and Found until she shows up to claim it.  Ben Mendelsohn of Bloodline,  who won Best Supporting Drama actor, was also a no-show.  John Oliver captured the best variety talk series award for Last Week Tonight with John Oliver , besting competitors including Jerry Seinfeld and host Jimmy Kimmel who received barbed consolation on stage from Matt Damon, his longtime faux nemesis. The loss “makes a lot of sense,” Damon said. The People v. O.J. Simpson , which earned the second-highest number of nominations, converted five to trophies Sunday. The dramatic retelling of the football star’s murder trial was honoured as best limited series and writing, and earned awards for stars Courtney B. Vance, Sterling K. Brown and Sarah Paulson. “Obama out, Hillary in,” Vance said as he wrapped his victory speech.  Regina King claimed the award for supporting actress in a limited series for American Crime , her second trophy for the program.  Louie Anderson was honored as best supporting actor in a comedy series for his portrayal of a loving but tough mom in Baskets . “Mom, we did it!,” Anderson shouted, hoisting his trophy and dedicating the award to his late mother, Ora Zella Anderson. “I have not always been a good man but I play one hell of a woman.” Saturday Night Live cast member Kate McKinnon won the trophy for best supporting actress in a comedy for, officially, playing various characters. But she knew who to credit. “Thank you, Ellen DeGeneres, thank you, Hillary Clinton,” she said, naming two of the famous people she’s caricatured on the show. The Democratic presidential contender responded quickly with a tweet —“Congratulations on your Emmy, Kate! Big fan of yours, too.” The ceremony started out with a political edge. In a video bit, Jimmy Kimmel was shown trying to get to the ceremony and encountering former GOP presidential contender Jeb Bush as a limo driver. “Did you know you could make $12 an hour working for Uber?” a game Bush said, smiling. He advised Kimmel that “if you run a positive campaign, the voters will ultimately make the right choice“then told Kimmel curtly it was a joke. In his opening monologue, the host said he was holding “Celebrity Apprentice” producer Mark Burnett responsible for the “Donald Trump phenomenon.” In an attempt at comedy that fell flat, the ceremony announcer indicated that Bill Cosby would be taking the stage. After an awkward silence, Kimmel said it was a joke the TV star embroiled in decades-old accusations of sexual assault wasn’t invited. A pair of key changes made by the TV academy may have affected the outcomes in Sunday’s 27 categories. It revised how votes are cast and counted, switching from a ranking and points system to letting voters simply check off their top choice. That sharpened the selection process and might have affected past winners who managed to collect enough second—place votes to overcome the competition. In another revision, this one implemented last year, voting was expanded from blue-ribbon panels to depending on the award giving substantially more or all of the academy’s 20,000-plus members the chance to vote for finalists."

        "Mumbai photographer wins wildlife award": "City-based photographer and conservationist Nayan Khanolkar has won the Wildlife Photographer of the Year Award in the Urban Wildlife category, in a contest organised by the Natural History Museum, London and BBC Wildlife, regarded as the most prestigious in the world. Mr. Khanolkar’s photograph, ‘The Alley Cat’, was taken in the Aarey Milk Colony, on the fringe of the Sanjay Gandhi National Park (SGNP).The winning photograph highlights the co-existence between leopards and the Warli tribe living in the national park. Mr. Khanolkar was determined to debunk the image of the snarling beast. His photograph shows a lone leopard walking down a quiet lane, showing how the wild cat is accepted as part of the lives of the locals. “I wanted the leopard to be an integrated part of the urban environment,” Mr. Khanolkar said from London, where he has gone to receive the award. He believes that putting a stop to relocating leopards solved the conflict in several areas of the city. “I wanted to convey that if co-existence with predators is possible in the centre of a metropolis, there is no reason why it shouldn’t be possible anywhere else in the world,” he said. He found it challenging to convince the locals that the project was aimed at mitigating human-leopard conflict. “I’m happy because this message will now reach a wider audience,” he said.Mr. Khanolkar’s interest in documenting the man-leopard conflict began in 2011 when he saw photographs of a leopard being burnt near Corbett Tiger Reserve. After a year of research on the movement of leopards in several protected areas of the national park, he set up a ‘camera trap’ (where the camera’s shutter is triggered by movement within its focus area) at a particular spot. It took four months to get the desired image. The location was near a house where a boy was attacked by a leopard in 2012. “When I met the father back then, he told me, ‘We know our leopards well, and the one that attacked him was an outsider’.”Another Indian photographer, Ganesh H. Shankar, also won the award in the Birds’ category for ‘Eviction Attempt’, which captured an Indian rose-ringed parakeet combating a Bengal monitor lizard over a nesting hole. American photojournalist Tim Laman was declared the overall winner of the competition.The winning images will go on display at the Natural History Museum, London and on the BBC website."

Talking to journalists after a meeting with party leaders here, Ms. Banerjee asked why no report on demonetisation was not tabled in Parliament when it passed two Bills, despite disruptions.  “The country is not safe under his leadership. On the slogan of Modi Hatao, Desh Bachao,  we will have campaigns across the State,” she said. “Now, Alibaba and four aides are taking all decisions, even the Finance Minister doesn’t know about it. Only God knows what is happening in the country.

In a rare gesture, tabla maestro Zakir Hussain will give a solo recital, before being joined onstage by santoor genius Shiv Kumar Sharma.In addition to their backgrounds in Hindustani classical music and their inimitable prowess in translating life’s experiences on their respective instruments, the stalwarts have many other things in common. Sharma is a great composer and had made a mark as a tabla player in the early phase of his musical journey.Hussain too is a prolific composer, as was his father-guru Ustad Alla Rakha Khan, credited in Bollywood as music director A.R. Qureshi. “My father would say, ‘To be good at tabla, you should also be able to sing’,” the tabla maestro said in a previous interview. “If I don’t know the composition, lyrics, their meaning, mood, words’ syllables, it is impossible to accompany. It entails knowing your craft with all the shades it has to offer.” Then there’s santoor maestro Sharma, who hails from a family of scholarly Kashmiri Pundits who, as the members of the royal court, enjoyed the company of learned priests and educationists. At an early age, Sharma was exposed to scriptures and their inner philosophy pretty early in life. “Spirituality and music are like two faces of the same coin; ek hi sikke ke do pehlu hain ,” he says. “Simply because our music is an integral part of the Naad-yoga . I play with the aloofness of a spectator (‘ drashta-bhaav ’) despite being totally engrossed in my music. In fact, what I sing inwards gets translated on my instrument.” Like all their performances and even with the upcoming one, the musicians tap into their instrument’s ability to emanate the essence of its artiste’s persona. “It is very difficult for Indian musicians to explain how we perform on stage spontaneously,” says Hussain. “There is nothing that can describe a package or manual called riyaaz  (ensuring great results). My father had [said to] me, ‘Identify what you do best and what you are comfortable with. And make that the core of your expression. That will help you define yourself as an individual musician, with your own identity. Keep an eye on the sam (first beat). Drive, run, fly; do whatever you can, but you must know where to arrive, instinctively!’” Zakir Hussain and Shiv Kumar Sharma will perform at 6.30 p.m. today at the NCPA. "

Speaking to The Hindu,  RSS sources said the move is to “uphold Hindutva” in Bengal. Meanwhile, Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee has called a meeting of the Trinamool Congress’ core committee on April 1, aimed at formulating a strategy to combat the RSS and BJP.The RSS has planned “six mega rallies” in Kolkata and at least 175 across the State, Sangh officials said. In Kolkata, rallies will be taken out in Khidderpur, Burrabazar, Baranagar, Hastings and Brace Bridge areas. The rallies are not being organised directly under the banner of RSS but by affiliated committees — the Ramnavami Udyapon Samity and Shree Shree Ram Navami Utsav Samity.  On the Trinamool core committee meeting, a senior leader told The Hindu , “Among other things, we will discuss how to counter RSS and BJP in the State, as neither the CPI(M) nor the Congress is keen to resist the BJP.” On the rallies on April 6, however, he said, “If these are usual rallies, why should it be discussed?” "

The United Nations Global Compact (UNGC) is an initiative by the global body to encourage private sector companies to do more in achieving the Sustainable Development Goals, the deadline for which is less than 5,000 days away, Ms Kingo noted. “India is the land of opportunity for sustainable development,” Ms Kingo said while speaking at an event organised by the UNGC. “More than 50% of the progress towards the global (Sustainable Development) Goals will come from India. The report we have come out with shows that there is $1 trillion worth of market opportunities for companies working in the sustainable area in India and employment generation of 72 million by 2030.”The major areas where these gains are possible include food and agriculture, energy, cities, health, and construction, Ms Kingo added. The report citing the basis for these figures will be released on Thursday.“Inequality, tackling which is goal 10 in the Sustainable Development Goals, has been rising but there has been a huge jump recently,” Nisha Agrawal, Chief Executive Officer, Oxfam India said while also speaking at the event. “It is in the companies’ self-interest to address these problems.”“Look at inequality, where the top small section commands most of the wealth,” Ms Agrawal added. “This affects the spending power of the bulk of the population, which hurts the companies. The same can be argued with climate change and environmental effects. Companies can’t first do their production and then look at the environment.”Ms Kingo highlighted the example of Adidas as a company trying to do its part in helping the environment. “Adidas has made a sports shoe made of the waste plastics collected from the oceans, which is increasingly becoming a major pollution problem.”"

The trek, flagged off by Kalpetta MLA C.K. Saseendran, witnessed participation by 10,842 students from 109 schools in Kozhikode, Wayanad and Malappuram districts, besides environmentalists and the general public walking down the ghat road from Lakkidi to the 4th hairpin bend, enjoying the natural beauty and biodiversity of the Western Ghats. However, as in the previous years, the participants missed out on the rain, which would have been a welcome add-on experience. In a motion presented on the occasion, the samithi demanded that the State government follow the regulations on building permits in ecologically fragile zones. The other motions called for a ban on flex boards and businesses on the ghat, which are the main reasons behind the plastic waste accumulation and pollution of water sources on the ghat, and ensuring that the natural streams remain unpolluted.Awards were given to schools that had the maximum number of students participating in the Mazhayatra. Prizes were handed over to the winners of a quiz competition organised in connection with the event.The Kainatti Padmaprabha public library team that cleans the ghat road every fortnight, the Churam Samrakshana Samithi, that offers help on the ghat round-the-clock and the Cheruvadi Development Forum that coordinates the cleaning activities were honoured on the occasion. School teams conducted presentations on the environment, biodiversity, energy and cleanliness and used eco-friendly articles as props. The Mazhayatra was recorded by Citizen TV to be submitted to the Guinness Book of World Records as the biggest gathering of students for environment. The Mazhayatra was organised in association with the National Green Corps, school eco clubs and Darsanam Samskarika Vedi."

He was 94.  Best known for his political essays and his novel When Memory Dies , Mr. Sivanandan made original contributions to understanding communities of resistance in Britain, focussing on the Black working class that he felt was more prone to the “racism that kills”, as opposed to the “racism that discriminates” against middle-class Black people. This position was at the heart of his work as director of the London-based Institute of Race Relations (IRR), an educational and campaigning organisation, which he reoriented towards a critical evaluation of racism and imperialism and towards building Black and third-world resistance. “It takes nerve to stay so close to the substantial reality of those who have suffered such pain and hope,” renowned art critic John Berger told The Guardian in 1999, about Mr. Sivanandan’s celebrated novel, considered by many as a politically significant work.

Nadkarni, appearing for the MoEF&CC, said a study was underway and that he would get back to the court with its details.To this, the bench said if the Government did not have any material of its own and claimed that a scientific study carried out by any foreign scientist on the issue was useless, then it was creating a problem for itself as well as the people.“It is a very, very serious matter. It is a critical problem. It is going to impact children who are already born and who are going to be born. We do not think that the Government of India will take it so lightly.“It will have an impact for generations. There are slogans of sustainable development but this is very serious,” the bench observed.Advocate Aparajita Singh, assisting the court as an amicus curiae (friend of the court), told the bench that the BS-VI norms should be made applicable in the Delhi-National Capital Region (NCR) from April 1, 2019 as the government itself had acknowledged that the people were suffering due to pollution.She also questioned the April 1, 2020 timeline for BS-VI norms.“They cannot take the health of citizens so lightly,” Ms. Singh said, adding that as per the Centre’s affidavit, ₹80,000 crore were spent on BS-VI norms.Electric carsShe also raked up the issue of electric cars in India and asked that when the manufacturers were able to make these cars, then why could they not shift to the BS-VI norms earlier.Ms. Singh also said that cars which were not BS-VI compliant should not be allowed to be registered after the new norms came into effect.Referring to data, she said pollution would come down by around 80% in case of the BS-VI vehicles, as compared to the BS-IV ones."

Statements variedAfter the police reached the spot, they took the two men to the police station to record their statement. The men claimed that they were robbed at gunpoint.“When the two were initially questioned, there were some discrepancies in their versions of events from the day. Later, when the two were taken to separate rooms and asked to explain the incident, their versions did not match,” Mr. Lall said. Wanted to evade arrestDuring sustained interrogation, they broke down and confessed that they wanted to flee with the money and staged the robbery to evade an arrest.The police said Yogesh, after withdrawing the money, called his brother Rajesh and handed him a portion of the amount.

Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar is scheduled to join Mr Shah for both breakfast and dinner during the visit. Top sources in the BJP have confirmed that while Mr Shah will be largely busy with organisational meetings, two one-on-one meetings have been scheduled with Mr. Kumar. “ Adhyakshaji  (BJP president Amit Shah) will be having breakfast with the Chief Minister (Nitish Kumar) at the State guest house where he will be staying. After addressing organisational meetings like the social media volunteers meet, a meeting of vistaraks , core committee and Shakti Kendra meetings, he will have dinner with Nitish Kumar at the latter’s residence,” said a source. State BJP president Nityanand Rai confirmed the two meetings. “Seat sharing talks are on the anvil, and a formula that will be good for all stakeholders will be formulated,” added the source. No other details were shared as party men and allies like the Lok Janshakti Party (LJP) and Rashtriya Lok Samata Party (RLSP) are holding their peace.Electoral equation“We won 22 seats in 2014 on our own; some of them were seats where JD(U) used to win as part of the NDA. Therefore, the seat adjustment is not just about absolute numbers but particular seats and this will have implications for some sitting BJP MPs too,” added the source.  Meanwhile, a political observer in Bihar told The Hindu , “I don’t see any electoral dividend for the BJP to take JD(U) along with it in Lok Sabha poll…for the BJP, a triangular contest will always benefit as both RJD and JD(U) would cut each other’s backward caste vote while the BJP’s vote bank will be intact in the name of PM Narendra Modi”. “Though, it will be a different ball game if JD(U) compromises with 9-10 seats with the BJP promising it a lion share in the State Assembly poll in 2020,” said political analyst Ajay Kumar."

        "‘Bharat’ goes the ‘Tubelight’ route": " Even when a Salman Khan film performs badly, it almost always crosses that coveted ₹100 crore mark other films yearn for. Of course the scale and budget of a Khan film is much larger than most Bollywood releases. Take Tubelight for instance, which is one of Khan’s biggest flops. Made on a reported budget of ₹135 core, it still opened at ₹20.55 crore net and made ₹114.57 crore net. The difference (and more) was made up with the sale of satellite and digital rights. Star powerThis year, Khan’s Eid release, Bharat’s box office collections have disappointed. In two weeks, the film has collected a respectable ₹192.41 crore net on a reported budget of ₹300 crore and a 4,500-screen release. The film opened to a whopping ₹41.75 crore net. “[Bharat] has performed much better than Race 3 , at least opening wise,” says Shailesh Kapoor of Ormax Media, a firm specialising in trade insights. ‘Last year’s Eid release Race 3 was made on a reported budget of ₹185 crore net and opened to ₹27.69 crore net, eventually earning ₹166.85 crore net. “Irrespective of the film not doing well, the film is not going to affect his stardom.Bharat opened well despite a [World Cup] cricket match on the same day,” says Kapoor. “If there was anything to do with his fans or stardom, it would reflect in the opening. The numbers prove that people want to watch a Salman Khan film on the first day.” Sreedhar Pillai, a trade analyst echoes Kapoor’s sentiments about Khan’s unrelenting stardom. “Every actor goes through these kind of things and we have to wait and watch [for Dabangg 3 ],” says Pillai. “I think he’s way ahead of SRK and ahead of Aamir Khan at the Indian box office.” But Pillai does agree that Bharat  has performed poorly all over India, especially in the Tamil Nadu and Kerala territory where Khan has a huge following. The film has reportedly made just over 50% of what Tiger Zinda Hai  (2017) collected in the Southern region. Where the spy action thriller made ₹5 crore net in Tamil Nadu and Kerala, Bharat  has reportedly made measly ₹3 crore net. Trouble or triumphA true Salman Khan hit would be a film that crosses the ₹300 crore mark, like Bajrangi Bhaijaan (2015, ₹315.49 crore net), Sultan (2016, ₹300.67 crore net) and Tiger Zinda Hai (₹339 crore net) did. But all three films performed well in both urban multiplexes as well as single screen theatres. Bharat, on the other hand, has not resonated in urban metros. Since single screens these days contribute to a mere 30% of box office collections, these numbers are insufficient to hold a film in good stead. Besides a Khan film performing poorly could spell trouble for the box office this year, which is soon to reach the half-yearly mark at the end of this month.

We first heard about Chandrayaan-3 from the then chiefs of ISRO and JAXA in November 2017 during the Asia Pacific Regional Space Agency Forum APRSAF-24 held in Bengaluru.  Two inter-governmental discussions during the Prime Minister's visit, in March this year and October 2018, also mentioned a ' joint lunar polar exploration mission'.Plans for an Indo-Japan lunar mission were in early stages and the initial studies and tasks of the two agencies were being worked out, the then ISRO Chairman and Secretary, Department of Space (DoS), A.S. Kiran Kumar; and JAXA president Naoki Okumura said almost two years back. The two space-faring countries are friends but have had little space talk together so far. ISRO should send a third lunar trip, once it completes the crewed space mission ‘Gaganyaan’ in 2022, Chaitanya Giri, fellow, Space and Ocean Studies Programme of Gateway House (Mumbai international relations think tank), told The Hindu . “[Chandrayaan-2] is a precursor of Chandrayaan-3, which is scheduled to make a sample return mission in 2023-2024,” said Dr. Giri, who has been part of the European Space Agency's Rosetta mission to a comet and worked in the area in the U.S. and Japan. India, which has set out to pioneer explorations in the Moon's South Pole, should not get left behind in the global space race. In the next 4-5 years alone, major space-faring nations are planning to send at least seven missions to the lunar South Pole. There would be big dividends from that region, from mining to habitation, he said .Dr. Giri observed that the U.S. was returning to the Moon around 2024 with crewed Artemis flybys and landers. Russia had lined up Luna 25 and 26 to pave the way for a future robotic habitat. China, which recently landed Chang'e-4 on the Moon's far side that is always turned away from the Earth, has lined up Chang'e-5 late this year or next year to bring samples back from the South Pole, and may also send two followons. Chang'e-5 is said to be the first lunar sample return mission being attempted since 1976.The ISRO should take up speedy construction of Chandrayaan-3 and develop a `public-private ecosystem of space capabilities', he said. In his view, the DoS must stop depending solely on ISRO and increasingly involve public and private sector entities, universities, start-ups and research labs to get this and other scientific projects quickly off the mark."

The leaked clip seems to have Vijay’s voice on the vocals — the first time ‘Thalapathy’ has sung for ARR, though the composer has worked with the actor in earlier films like Mersal, Sarkar  and so on. The clip was shared widely on social media, as well as Whatsapp on Friday evening. Fans eagerly waiting for the song update from AGS Cinemas, were left disappointed at the rumours, and posted a series of updates urging producer Archana Kalpathi to address the issue and make no sure no further fake recordings come out before their official release. Earlier, a week after Singappenney was leaked online, the makers released the track officially on July 23. In an exclusive chat with The Hindu  earlier, AR Rahman had said, “He (Vijay) has sung it well. His voice made a lot of difference to the song.” Bigil is Vijay and director Atlee’s third collaboration, after the successful Theri  and Mersal, and is set for a Deepavali release. It stars the likes of Vijay, Nayantara, Jackie Shroff, Kathir, among others. "

West Indies are scheduled to play three T20s and as many ODIs in India starting December 6. He is also unlikely to feature in the T20 games.“West Indies called me to play ODIs, but I am not going to play,” Gayle was quoted as saying by ESPNcricinfo, following his team Jozi Stars’ defeat in the MSL in South Africa.“They (selectors) want me to play with the youngsters but for this year I am going to take a break.” Gayle will also not play in the upcoming edition of Big Bash League in Australia.“I am not going to the Big Bash. I’m not sure what cricket will come up, I don’t even know how my name reached the BPL (Bangladesh league), but I have been drafted in a team and I don’t even know how that happened.” ‘Burden’ The 40-year old West Indies opener, who played for defending champions Jozi Stars in what was a disastrous MSL campaign for him, scored just 101 runs from six innings. He also lashed out at his critics.“As soon as I don’t perform for two or three games, then Chris Gayle is the burden for the team.“I am not talking for this team only. This is something I have analysed over the years playing franchise cricket. Chris Gayle is always a burden if I don’t score runs, two, three, four times.“It seems like that one particular individual is the burden for the team. And then you will hear bickering. I am not going to get respect. People don’t remember what you have done for them. I don’t get respect,” he added."

        "Filmmakers allege ‘backdoor censorship’ at Mumbai film festival": "Film-makers Anand Patwardhan and Pankaj Rishi Kumar along with others on Tuesday alleged “backdoor censorship” and “absolute control exercised from Delhi” in the selection of films to be screened at the 16th edition of the Mumbai International Film Festival (MIFF 2020).  Addressing a press conference, hours before the start of the festival, they also shared short clips and details of the films “rejected” by MIFF 2020. Pankaj Rishi Kumar’s Janani’s Juliet,  Anand Patwardhan’s Reason/Vivek, Deepti Gupta’s  Shut Up Sona  are three of the significant films that have not been found suitable for screening.  Pankaj Rishi Kumar’s Janani’s Juliet , a searing look at caste politics through the rehearsals and performance of an adaptation of Romeo and Juliet, won the Best Long Documentary prize at the International Documentary and Short Film Festival of Kerala ( IDSFFK).  Anand Patwardhan’s Reason/Vivek , that examines the systematic dismantling of the ideals of secular democracy in India, had its world premiere at the Toronto International Film Festival and won the Best Feature Documentary award at the renowned International Documentary Film Festival in Amsterdam(IDFA).  Deepti Gupta’s Shut Up Sona  on the outspoken singer Sona Mohapatra’s fight against sexual discrimination and harassment and for an equal space for women, is in the official line-up of the on-going International Film Festival of Rotterdam(IFFR). However, these three are just a few of the significant films that have not been found suitable for screening at the Mumbai International Film Festival that kicked off on Tuesday.MIFF is the oldest and largest biennial film festival of non feature films in South Asia and is organised by Films Division of the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting.It was launched in 1990 as Bombay International Film Festival. One of its highlights was that it did away with the requirement of censor certificates. Many Indian films critical of government policies and ideologies were not only selected in MIFF but even won awards. Among them were Patwardhan’s own In Memory of Friends, critical of the government’s role during anti-Sikh riots and sectarian violence in Punjab and Ranjan Palit and Vasudha Joshi’s Voices of Baliapal highlighting protests against a missile base in Orissa. Patwardhan even won the Dr V Shantaram lifetime achievement award for contribution to documentary film movement in India at the same festival in 2014.According to the film-makers it was in 2003, in the wake of the Gujarat carnage of 2002, that a censor requirement for Indian films at MIFF was introduced. As a counter to it, film-makers successfully mounted a popular protest festival called Vikalp. The censorship clause at MIFF was then withdrawn and stayed off the agenda. But by 2016 it started becoming increasingly clear that films critical of the ruling ideology would just not get selected in MIFF.  This year the prominent films that have been overlooked include Pradeep K.P. (Deepu)’s Our Gauri that follows the political journey of late Gauri Lankesh and her fight against right-wing communal forces. The week-long festival of documentary, short, fiction and animation films that starts today will conclude on February 3. Sunil Kumar’s Ammi is on student Najeeb’s disappearance on October 15, 2016 from the Jawaharlal Nehru University campus, New Delhi, and the lack of progress in the investigations by the various investigating agencies. Deepa Dhanraj’s We have not come here to die, is about students all over the country breaking the silence around their experiences of caste discrimination in universities and the start of anti-caste movement in the wake of the suicide by dalit Phd research scholar and activist Rohith Vemula.  Even films slightly against the philosophy of those in power have been rejected by the “sanskari panel,” alleged Mr. Patwardhan. A film on the syncretic culture of Delhi, Yousef’s Saeed’s Dilli Yadon ki Mehfil couldn’t pass muster. Neither could Vani Subramaniam’s take against death penalty--The Death of Us. According to Pankaj Rishi Kumar it is part of the larger agenda to control every institution. “They are not interested in arts and culture… In the future films won’t be made, save by the bhakts,” he said tongue in cheek.The filmmakers also highlighted that 23 hours of time reserved for competition films in the festival has been brought down steadily by about 8 hours, that the RTI to MIFF on the selection was not responded to because of some small technicality and that some of the administrators’ own films have been selected for the festival. Kumar and Patwardhan had filed a petition in the Bombay High Court asking the government to show cause as to why their films were rejected from all categories at MIFF. “While the case has now been withdrawn due to technical reasons, we are still gathering information on other acclaimed films left out of MIFF 2020,” said a press statement. The filmmakers said that they believed in democracy and fighting through constitutional means. They may plan on screening the films individually or collectively. “But they can crack down on a parallel festival too,” says Patwardhan.Two letter of support from international filmmakers and former members of MIFF jury were also shared with the press. These are by Mark Achbar - Head of Jury, MIFF 2014 and Silver Conch winner MIFF 1994 for the film “Manufacturing Consent” (a film on Noam Chomsky) and Nicolas Philibert – Golden Conch Winner (In the Land of the Deaf) MIFF 1994 and Jury member, MIFF 2004. “It will be a dent on the reputation of the festival. International filmmakers may not come for a government controlled festival,” said Patwardhan."

That is sport - things can turnaround quickly,” said Djokovic.“I have played really well in most of the matches. This is a big win for me.”"

With more than three years gone, only 16 States out of 36 States/UT’s have broadly aligned their policy with RoW Policy 2016,” said T. R. Dua, director-general, Taipa. The RoW rules, which were notified in November 2016, provide for a framework to give approvals for setting up of telecom towers, laying of fibre cables and settling disputes in a time-bound manner. “COVID-19 outbreak has created an unprecedented crisis across the globe because of which the government has directed public and private employees to work from home. This has led to over 30% increase in data consumption... Some cities like Hyderabad and Bengaluru have seen cellular network data consumption increase by 70% since the lockdown began,” the association said in a statement."

Demand fell to previously unseen lows, led by a 65% decline in China, the largest jewellery consumer and the first market to succumb to the outbreak,” the report said.However, central banks continued to buy gold, though at a much slower pace, as global gold reserves grew by 145 tonnes in the first three months of the current calendar year.Interestingly, Russia has announced it would suspend its long-term buying programme thereby signalling a slowdown in global net buying for the second quarter and beyond.On the price front, sharp investment inflows helped push the gold price in dollar terms to an eight-year high following which the demand in value terms reached $55 billion, the highest since the second quarter of 2013. Incidentally, the gold price reached a new record high in Indian rupees and Turkish lira, among others."

        "Coronavirus | WHO raises concern over use of BCG vaccine": " In a letter published in The Lancet on April 30, World Health Organization (WHO) Director-General Tedros A Ghebreyesus and others highlight a few critical issues over the use of BCG vaccine for COVID-19. They underscore the importance of randomised controlled trials of the vaccine to understand its safety and efficacy before using it on healthcare workers. Randomised controlled trials using BCG vaccine are under way in the Netherlands and Australia to find out whether the vaccine can reduce the incidence and severity of COVID-19 among healthcare workers. Also read | No proof yet that BCG benefits against coronavirus, says expertThe authors do state that the BCG vaccine, which “enhances the innate immune response to subsequent infections, might reduce viral load after SARS-COV-2 exposure, with a consequent less severe COVID-19 and more rapid recovery”.A study, posted on March 28 in a preprint server medRxiv, found an association between countries that have a universal BCG vaccination and reduced coronavirus cases — and even deaths. Preprints are yet to be peer-reviewed and published in scientific journals.The authors cite five reasons countries should wait for the results of the BCG vaccine randomised controlled trials. According to them, the association of fewer COVID-19 cases in countries that have a universal BCG vaccination programme is based on population rather than individual data. Second, the beneficial effects of the BCG vaccine given at birth are “unlikely” to reduce the severity of COVID-19 decades later. “One reason for this is that the beneficial off-target effects of the BCG vaccine might be altered by subsequent administration of a different vaccine,” they write. Also read | Doctors wary of BCG vaccine study | Correlation does not mean causation, say doctors about BCG vaccine studyThird, there is a possibility, even if remote, that the BCG vaccine ramps up the immune system leading to exacerbation of COVID-19 in a small population of patients with a severe disease. It is already known that the virus induces cytokine storm in some patients, leading to further complications — and even death. Fourth, if not effective against the novel coronavirus, BCG vaccination is likely to give a false sense of security to people, especially during the pandemic. And finally, using the vaccine without evidence of its benefits could further jeopardise vaccine supply, which is already short, to protect children against disseminated TB in high-risk countries.  “BCG given early in life does improve the immune system. The vaccine can prevent intracellular infections. So the protective effect of BCG against COVID-19 is a biologically plausible hypothesis,” Prof. Gagandeep Kang, executive director of the Translational Health Science and Technology Institute (THSTI), Faridabad, had earlier told The Hindu .

Chahal held a meeting with assistant and deputy commissioners on Tuesday as the cyclone will be making a landfall on Wednesday. We are prepared: CMChief Minister Uddhav Thackeray on Tuesday, in a televised address, said, “We can only pray that its intensity decreases by the time it reaches us. But we are prepared. We have contacted all fisherfolk in the State and are bringing them back home.” There were some from Palghar with whom we were unable to get in touch with earlier in the day, but we have now reached them as well. They won’t be allowed to venture out into the sea for the next two days.”He also warned of possible power cuts. He said, “Keep your belongings secured. Store drinking water. Charge all appliances that run on battery. Pay attention to announcements on Doordarshan and Akashwani.” The Chief Minister appealed to people not to spread or fall prey to rumours. He said, “Local administrations are in action everywhere. Cooperate with them. You will be informed in time in case you need to be relocated.”Mr. Thackeray also advised people in rural areas to chalk out spaces in their houses where they would be safest in case of strong winds, and advised them against entering temporary structures like sheds. “The government will keep updating you as and when we get information on the cyclone’s intensity and direction. Let us face this challenge with the same fortitude and presence of mind that we showed with COVID-19,” he said. ‘Fortify CCCs’Mr. Chahal has ordered officers to ensure that all COVID-19 Care Centres (CCCs) are structurally stable. The BMC had created CCCs overnight to shift high-risk contacts or asymptomatic patients. However, after the BMC had to shift people out of the COVID-19 hospital at Bandra Kurla Complex, questions were raised about the structural stability of the jumbo facilities as well as other CCCs.Ashok Khairnar, assistant municipal commissioner of H East ward, said, “Even when we rapidly took over buildings for CCCs, it was not done blindly. In fact, we kept the monsoon in mind and selected buildings that are in good condition. Since a few of them are lying unused, I will be using them to shift people from low-lying areas.” Mr. Khairnar has created four disaster response teams in his ward and provided them with 10 personal protective equipment (PPE) kits each.The BMC has also instructed construction contractors to secure all under-construction sites to avoid incidents of scaffolding or cranes collapsing. “We have been asked to ensure the stability of hoardings,” said Prashant Sapkale, assistant municipal commissioner of K East ward.The BMC has also appealed to people to carry tools such as hammers when they venture out in their cars on Wednesday to avoid getting stuck inside on flooded roads. Last year, two people died after they got locked in.The BMC has kept officers on high alert through Tuesday night keeping in mind the collapse of trees, dilapidated structures and walls, flooding, short circuit or fire incidents. Guardian Minister for Mumbai, Aaditya Thackeray, who was present at the meeting, has asked officers to focus on parts of city that are prone to landslides, flooding and dilapidated buildings collapsing. He also sought provision of packaged food and water for migrants or homeless people. Staffers shifting COVID-19 patients will be provided with PPEs.“We have already started shifting people from landslide-prone or flood-prone areas,” said Mr. Chahal. When told that most municipal hospital generators can run only for four to five hours, Mr. Chahal simply said, “We are prepared.”The Mumbai Fire Brigade has stationed 93 lifeguards and 150 flood rescue members at fire stations for cyclone preparedness."

        "The Hindu Explains | Is COVID-19 setting off a bradykinin storm in the body?": "The story so far: Scientists are still trying to understand the causes for the rapid deterioration in some patients with COVID-19 . While the cytokine storm is able to explain certain aspects of what goes wrong, doctors treating patients are often foxed by the severity with which the SARS-CoV-2 virus seems to affect some people. A supercomputer’s recent analysis of data on the contents collected earlier from the lungs of patients with the COVID-19 infection has showed that a phenomenon called a ‘bradykinin storm’ might explain how the virus works in the body, including some of the more puzzling extreme events. How has this explanation emerged?  This plausible explanation has emerged from the data analytics work that a team of scientists led by Dan Jacobson at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORLN) in the U.S. have been doing employing the super computer Summit. In a paper published in July in eLife , a peer reviewed journal, Michael R. Garvin et al advance the bradykinin hypothesis as a means of explaining some of the more deadly effects the virus has on the human body.  Also read | Smoking tied to COVID-19 riskWhat is the bradykinin hypothesis? Bradykinin is a compound that is related to pain sensation and lowering blood pressure in the human body. According to the researchers, “SARS-CoV-2 uses a human enzyme called ACE2 like a ‘Trojan Horse’ to sneak into the cells of its host. ACE2 lowers blood pressure in the human body and works against another enzyme known as ACE (which has the opposite effect).” The analyses further found that the virus caused the levels of ACE to fall in the lungs, and consequently pushed up the levels of ACE2. As a chain reaction, this increases the levels of the molecule bradykinin in the cells, causing a bradykinin storm. Bradykinin causes the blood vessels to expand and become leaky, leading to swelling of the surrounding tissue.  In addition, the levels of a substance called hyaluronic acid, which can absorb more than 1,000 times its own weight in water to form a hydrogel, increased. “In effect, the bradykinin storm-induced leakage of fluid into the lungs combined with the excess hyaluronic acid would likely result in a Jello-like substance that is preventing oxygen uptake and carbon dioxide in the lungs of severely affected COVID-19 patients,” the researchers explain. This rapid accumulation of fluid in the lungs of patients sometimes makes even the most sophisticated intensive care, including ventilators, futile. Meanwhile, The Scientist reported that Frank van de Veerdonk, an infectious disease specialist at the Radboud University Medical Centre in the Netherlands, and his group independently came up with a hypothesis that a dysregulated bradykinin system was leading to leaky blood vessels in the lungs and perhaps causing excess fluid to build up.  Coronavirus | India clears COVID-19 tests without prescriptionIs more confirmation needed?TheScientist brought in Josef Penninger, director of the Life Sciences Institute at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver, to weigh in on this question. “It does make a lot of sense,” he told the magazine. He went on to add that further confirmation was needed, in terms of actually measuring the proteins. The magazine also reported the efforts of van de Veerdonk to set up mass spectrometry to measure kinins in the plasma. What follows confirmation of this hypothesis?Jacobson and other scientists have advocated targeting the bradykinin pathway to evolve more therapeutic interventions to offset the severe effects of COVID-19. Repurposing of available drugs, subject to the outcome of clinical trials, has also been suggested. "

        "Mercedes’ EVs to be powered by solid-state batteries. What are these batteries?": "Most electronic products and electric vehicles use lithium-ion batteries to store power and to run devices.But Mercedes-Benz AG is working with a Canadian battery material specialist Hydro-Québec to develop solid state batteries for its electric cars.The duo agree that solid-state lithium metal batteries will be the next important milestone in electric vehicle technology.\"Our development programme will allow us to test new materials, and respond to the concerns of automobile manufacturers,\" said Karim Zaghib, General Manager of Hydro-Québec’s center of excellence in transportation electrification and energy storage.Solid-state batteries use a solid electrolyte, instead of the liquid electrolyte used in lithium-ion batteries.A battery stores chemical energy, and converts it into electrical energy. It has three basic parts: anode, cathode, and electrolyte. Cathode is the positive end of the battery, and anode is negative; they are the two electrodes. And electrolyte transports ions, electrically charged atoms, between the two ends.Solid state batteries with a very high energy density can store more energy than lithium ion batteries. They can also last longer, and are safer to use, said Zaghib.The chemical reactions in the battery causes a build up of electrons at the anode and a shortage of electrons at the cathode. This results in an electrical difference between the anode and the cathode. The electrons want to get rid of this difference and move to the cathode.But the electrolyte blocks the electrons from moving from the anode to the cathode within the battery. If the battery is connected to an external circuit, the electrons move through it. This flow of electrons provides an electric current that can be used to do work.Solid electrolytes open up the scope of using new types of anode like lithium metal. This makes it possible to have higher energy content with better safety than today’s graphite anode.New generations of these materials will be quick to charge and are non-flammable.The companies are now working on a ceramic solution that can be used as solid-state electrolytes. Ceramic materials are stable in very high temperatures. They can also tolerate such high temperatures during fast charging.There is not one battery technology that can suit all industries and applications. We will need diverse energy storage technologies for a sustainable future, said Zaghib."

This provides that under specific special situations mentioned in the Rule, relaxation, abbreviation, omission, or deferment of data, including local clinical trial data, may be considered for approval. Similarly, other countries also have laws. The timeline for issuing licence is under the national regulator’s domain,” said Mr. Bhushan.He added that once a green signal was obtained from scientists, the Centre “will launch massive production of the vaccine”.“The Central government has made elaborate preparations and drawn an outline to ramp up production of vaccines to make it available to each and every person in the shortest possible time. We will be running parallel vaccination programmes for several priority groups,” said Mr. Bhushan.The Health Ministry explained that, at present, there are around 2.39 lakh vaccinators (auxiliary nurse midwife or ANM) across the country, but only 1.54 lakh ANMs will be used for COVID-19 vaccination to ensure that the COVID-19 vaccination drive would have minimal impact on routine health services, including routine immunisation.It added that the National Expert Group on Vaccine Administration for COVID-19 has made recommendations on prioritised population groups, including healthcare providers, personnel from State and Central police, Armed Forces, Home Guards, civil defence and disaster management volunteers, municipal workers, and persons above 50 years of age.Mr. Bhushan added that the process of collecting databases of health workers has started across all States and UTs and Central Ministries. “This data is being uploaded on CO-WIN software which will be used for the vaccination process. CO-WIN platform is a mobile application, which can be downloaded for free by all, for vaccination delivery. The mobile app will record vaccine data and will be used for remote real-time monitoring,” he added.Giving details of the current cold chain system, the Ministry said that it consisted of 85,634 equipment for storage of vaccines at about 28,947 cold chain points across the country. “Current cold chain is capable of storing additional quantities of COVID-19 vaccine required for first 3 crore health care and frontline workers. Additional supplies would be available to States/UTs beginning 10th December 2020,” stated the MinistryAsking the people to have faith in vaccines cleared by Indian regulators, V.K. Paul, Member (Health), NITI Aayog, speaking at the conference, said: “This is a scientific, technical body with vast experience. Don’t succumb to contrary opinion, have faith in these institutions. Take into consideration only accountable transparent information from the government, otherwise we will not find ourselves standing strong against the pandemic. We are chasing the virus and we need to make sure that the virus doesn’t chase us.”He added that besides the three vaccine candidates that are before the regulator seeking permission for emergency use, other vaccines may also arrive. Replying to a question on the data being relied upon for possible issue of emergency use approval, Indian Council of Medical Research head Balram Bhargava added that the regulator probably has to be satisfied with risk-benefit ratio in this emergency situation.The Health Ministry, meanwhile, giving information on the current COVID-19 situation in India, said that while cases are increasing around the world, there had been a steady and continuous decline in new cases in India since mid-September. “Maharashtra, Kerala, Karnataka, West Bengal and Delhi contribute to 54% of the total active cases in the country. Today, the active cases in the country are less than 4 lakh and case positivity rate is decreasing,” Mr. Bhushan said."

        "Two minors held for killing 10-yr-old boy": "Two minors have been apprehended for allegedly killing a 10-year-old boy whose body was recovered from a mosque in north-east Delhi’s Khajuri Khas, the police said on Saturday. Deputy Commissioner of Police (North-East) Ved Prakash Surya said that one Shamim, a resident of Shri Ram Colony, lodged a missing report of his son at Khajuri Khas police station on Friday. He told the police that the boy was missing since the intervening night of Thursday and Friday. Shamim said that on Thursday around 6.50 p.m., his son went to Madina Masjid of Shri Ram Colony, but did not return. Body was found buriedDuring investigation, a joint search was conducted by the police and the parents of child in the nearby areas of their house. The boy’s body was found buried under the debris in a corner on the second floor of the Madina Masjid. Shamim identified him as his son, the police said. The police analysed CCTV footage of the area and all persons present at the masjid at 7.15 p.m. were examined. It was found that the victim was last seen with his two minor friends. “Both the juveniles were examined separately and contradictions were found in their versions. Later, they confessed to killing their friend and were apprehended,” Mr .Surya said. During interrogation, the accused allegedly told the police they wanted to extort money from the deceased’s father by kidnapping him. Earlier, a few ago, the accused had given the victim water infused with sleeping pills. However, nothing happened to him and their plan flopped. On Friday, the 17-year-old boy gave money to the other accused and asked him to bring momos from a nearby vendor. On the pretext of eating momos, they took the victim to the first floor of the masjid where they enjoyed the snack and thereafter, took the deceased to the roof of the mosque and strangulated him before hiding his body under the debris. Decomposed body In another incident, a decomposed body of a woman was found in a drain in east Delhi’s New Ashok Nagar on Friday. The deceased seems to around 25 to 30 years old. No physical injuries are apparent. Teams are looking to identify the body, the police said. "

        "Donald Trump impeachment trial | Chilling new security video shows police begging for help, senators fleeing": " Prosecutors unveiled chilling new security video in Donald Trump’s impeachment trial on Wednesday, showing the mob of rioters breaking into the U.S. Capitol , smashing windows and doors and searching menacingly for Vice President Mike Pence and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi as overwhelmed police begged on their radios for help. In the previously unreleased recordings, the House prosecutors displayed gripping scenes of how close the rioters were to the country’s leaders, roaming the halls chanting “Hang Mike Pence,\" some equipped with combat gear and members of extremist groups among the first inside. Outside, the mob had set up a makeshift gallows. At one dramatic moment, the video shows police shooting into the crowd through a broken window, killing a San Diego woman, Ashli Babbitt .  The Vice President, who had been presiding over a session to certify Joe Biden’s victory over Mr. Trump — thus earning Mr. Trump's censure — is shown being rushed to safety, where he sheltered in an office with his family just 100 feet from the rioters. Ms. Pelosi was evacuated from the complex as her staff hid behind doors in her suite of offices. Though most of the Senate jurors have clearly already made up their minds on acquittal or conviction, they were riveted on the video and audio as the rioters took over the chamber where the impeachment trial is now being held. Screams from the audio filled the chamber. At times, it almost seemed as if some senators were seeing and hearing Mr. Trump for the first time as he urged his supporters on.\"They did it because Donald Trump sent them on this mission,\" said House prosecutor Stacey Plaskett, the Democratic delegate representing the Virgin Islands. \"President Trump put a target on their backs and his mob broke into the Capitol to hunt them down.\"The stunning presentation opened the first full day of arguments in the trial as the prosecutors argued Mr. Trump was no “innocent bystander” but the “inciter in chief” of the deadly Capitol riot, a President who spent months spreading election lies and building a mob of supporters primed for his call to stop Mr. Biden’s victory."

District Collectors will control the distribution,” said Mr. Pawar at a meeting organised to take stock of the COVID-19 situation in the State in the wake of rising cases and deaths.Mr. Pawar also said that 30% of funds from the District Planning and Development Council (DPDC) can now be used to implement measures to fight COVID-19. Divisional Commissioners will get additional rights to spend funds for facilities in acquired private hospitals. He said, “The entire State machinery is working on a war footing. We are putting enormous efforts to ensure sufficient oxygen supply to hospitals. If required, a liquid oxygen plant can be set up near hospitals. Funds can be made available through the National Health Mission, Public Health Department, State Disaster Relief Fund and DPDC.”Mr. Pawar said the government decided not to allow retail sale of Remdesivir injections owing to instances of black marketing. “We have been directed to prepare guidelines for the use of this injection. District Collectors have the right to control its distribution,” he said.Meanwhile, the Opposition Bharatiya Janata Party claimed that the State government is not connecting with private companies producing Remdesivir. Leader of Opposition in the Council Pravin Darekar claimed he met officials of Group Pharma Pvt. Ltd. in Daman on Monday, which manufactures the medicine, and it was ready to provide 50,000 injections to Maharashtra. He said, “The State government and its officials are not taking the initiative to contact the company. This is irresponsible behaviour.”"

        "Upping the employability": "The disruptions caused by the pandemic have hurt all sectors, including India’s skill development ecosystem. While specialised skill development offers vocational training and promotes gainful employment opportunities via demand-supply mapping in various verticals, the pandemic has seen short- and long-term training courses being disrupted, thereby hurting millions of students.In the first wave, 30,000-plus Industrial Training Institutes and National Skills Training Institutes shut training centres temporarily, hurting the prospects of five million aspirants across India. Centres that continued with training during this time deployed digital and online modes of education. A National Skill Development Corporation partner launched online certification courses in Data Analytics, Technology and Finance while another offered online training in Retail, BFSI, beauty and healthcare sectors. Sustained reskillingIt’s clear the new normal has led to a greater emphasis on upskilling and reskilling, which will need to be undertaken periodically to remain relevant. Although companies make an effort to hire people with relevant skills and even train them further, the process often stops after an initial phase. Without periodic training, a glaring gap in employee skills imperils the future of workers and organisations.Whereas companies tout their Learning and Development (L&D) programmes, there is confusion about training and development courses. Employee training revolves around programmes that enable workers to pick up precise skills or imbibe knowledge that enhances job performance. Employee development, on the other hand, denotes a process in which the manager and worker get together in creating a development plan. As transformation across industries is driven by innovation and new technologies, a future-oriented approach calls for upskilling, reskilling or even relearning.Institutionalising skillingAll employees, no matter what their age, will need periodic training and refresher courses to avoid redundancy. Understanding the skills necessary under the new normal is also vital to keep pace with the dynamic nature of work. Some crucial skills include digital, cognitive, technical and socio-emotional. While being important in themselves, digital skills  will also mandate the ability to access, understand, evaluate, manage, integrate and create information appropriately and safely. Cognitive skills  will comprise the ability to comprehend complex ideas while adapting deftly to the environment as well as learning from experience and reason. This involves strong foundational and mathematical literacy together with critical thinking, creativity and problem-solving abilities. Technical skills denote acquired knowledge, expertise and the interactions required to perform select tasks, including the ability to skillfully use required tools, technologies or materials. Socio-emotional skills  pertain to one’s ability to negotiate interpersonal relationships and social situations efficiently. Such skills would include leadership, team spirit, self-control and grit. In addressing challenges in skills development and prioritising solutions, the World Bank Group (WBG) has developed the STEP (Skills Toward Employment and Productivity) programme. The WBG asserts that urgent reforms are required and warns of the tremendous costs of inaction. Worldwide, it states that countries must tackle three key issues vis-à-vis skills development: (1) access and completion (2) quality (3) relevance. First, from preschool and post-secondary education to vocational training, investments in education and skills development will lead to high returns. Second, many youngsters attend schools without learning basic literacy skills, which leaves them incapable of competing in job markets. Third, though technical and vocational training and education can provide the youth, especially women, relevant skills to compete for more remunerative jobs, engaging with local employers is vital to ascertain the curriculum and delivery of the programmes are as per market needs.Finally, with repeated waves of the pandemic underway, the writing is on the wall. Reskilling denotes surviving and thriving; not doing so would risk fading into redundancy.The writer is Chairman Automotive Skills Development Council (ASDC)"

        "Demand for cans in packing rising: Ball Beverage Packaging": "The demand for can-packed products would sharply rise, given the increasing emphasis on recycling and sustainable solutions, said Amit Lahoti, VP and GM, India and Southeast Asia, Ball Beverage Packaging.Pointing out that the per capita can consumption in India is one per annum while it is 70 in Vietnam and about 40 in China, he said consumer behaviour and safety concerns in the wake of the pandemic were fuelling demand for aluminium cans in India.Ball Beverages Packaging India is a unit of American multinational Ball Corporation and supplies aluminium cans for FMCG, soft drink and beer companies.“There is increased awareness around how plastic packaging is adversely affecting marine life, polluting the rivers and oceans and ending up as non-degradable heaps of waste at landfills. More Indians are now purchasing items based on social responsibility, inclusiveness and environmental impact,” he added.“COVID-19 has increased consumer awareness and commitment to buying sustainable products,” he added.To cater to the growing demand the company is expanding its packaging offering to various other segments such as sparkling water, wine and alcoholic drinks such as whiskey, rum and vodka.A well-known whiskey brand has been introduced in a 180 ml aluminium can and such packaging is being expanded to other brands and more markets. “Alcohol in 180 ml cans was recently introduced in Rajasthan [by a prominent spirits company]. We are looking to expand that into various other States,” Mr. Lahoti said.“We have also worked on our technology around coatings inside the cans to enable us to package wine in cans. A small serving in a can is always convenient,” he said, adding that two companies had introduced their wine in cans in India and also using the same for exports.“The other category that we have looked at is chilled water. This [is targeted at] premium locations where drinking water is being sold at ₹50-60 a bottle,” he added.The current market size for aluminium beverage cans is ₹1,500 crore per year and the annual market size for new categories such as spirits is estimated at ₹360 crore.According to company data, on a per-litre beverage basis, emissions associated with transporting and cooling aluminium cans are 7-21% lower than for plastic bottles and 35-49% lower than for glass bottles, [depending on the size of the comparative bottles as well as the types of refrigerators] in which the beverage is cooled prior to consumption.On a per container basis, the associated emissions of beverage packaged in a 12-ounce aluminium can is 45% lower than in a 12-ounce glass bottle and 49% lower than in a 20-ounce plastic bottle when delivered and chilled, in small markets and convenience stores as per comparative studies conducted by the company.Stressing that aluminium retains its value throughout the recycling process and can be repurposed into different products again and again, Mr. Lahoti said aluminium, after being used as a beverage can, can be used in making a car, a laptop or a bicycle and can even be recylced as a new can.“75% of the aluminium ever produced is still in use today. Metals do not lose quality while recycling aluminium reduces the energy required to produce aluminium,” he said."

This '’nupyogi’ Chief Minister himself listens to the recordings of some people every evening,” the Samajwadi Party chief alleged.He also asked reporters to “remain alert, if you are speaking to me”. The Yogi Adityanath government is running a WhatsApp University in the State, Mr. Yadav said derisively.The entire country knows that whenever the BJP is about to lose an election in any State, the “frequency of the misuse” of various enforcement agencies by the BJP rises, the former Chief Minister claimed.“The BJP is following the Congress' way. Like the Congress, it is rearing to use the Central agencies to instil fear (in rival political parties),” Mr. Yadav said.Meanwhile, Congress General Secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, when asked about the IT department raids against Samajwadi Party leaders, said, “I cannot comment on this, but the Government misuses the agencies. But, this was in my own case.” “This is the Government's way to harass the opposition leaders. They use agencies to do so. It's nothing new, we are seeing this for the past seven years.” About the phone tapping allegation, she said, “What is the job of a Government? To listen to the problems of the public, understand them and stop atrocities. Instead, this Government is tapping phones of the opposition.”According to SP sources, the IT department searches were conducted on Saturday at the residences of party spokesperson Rajiv Rai in Mau, Jainendra Yadav, who was the OSD when Akhilesh Yadav was the Chief Minister, in Vinay Khand at Gomti Nagar in Lucknow, businessman Rahul Bhasin in Lucknow and of contractor Manoj Yadav in Mainpuri.IT officials did not comment on the searches.SP spokesperson Rajiv Rai has alleged that the searches were “politically motivated”.Mr. Yadav said, “Seeing the atmosphere in the State, I can say the Yogi Government will not last. People have made up their minds for a 'yogya' (able) government. No government could be more 'unupyogi' (useless) than this. It has ruined Uttar Pradesh.”He also claimed the recent visits of Chief Ministers and Deputy Chief Ministers of the 12 BJP-ruled States to various places in Uttar Pradesh, including Varanasi and Ayodhya, was due to the saffron party's “fear of an impending defeat in the upcoming Assembly elections”."

But we should take the cooperation of Indian people, particularly those who can invest minimum ₹1 lakh in road projects, for which we have already developed a new model. We are awaiting approval from SEBI so that the common man can invest in NHAI (National Highways Authority of India). We are trying to give him an assured income of 7.5% to 8%,” Mr. Gadkari said at the “Countdown to Budget 2022” event organised by The HinduBusinessLine , in association with BoB Financial, the credit card arm of Bank of Baroda, and Hitachi India. “My interest is to give benefit to the poor people of this country, who can invest in their economy, because in India we have problems in pension, insurance and share economy. For that reason, if small people can invest in infrastructure and get 7.5% to 8% interest, it can be a great thing for them to contribute to infrastructure development and at the same time benefit from that,” the Minister said.Speaking about the upcoming Union Budget, Mr. Gadkari said he was hopeful that the proposals will expedite the growth of the Indian economy to make it the largest economy in the world.Advice to industryMr. Gadkari said that Indian industry and entrepreneurs should seize the opportunity arising from the “problems” facing China and “go for more exports” riding on the back of talent, availability of raw materials, power, and good infrastructure, to make the economy strong.Stressing that agriculture was the “most important priority” of the government, he outlined several initiatives taken, which will create more jobs in rural, tribal and 120 aspiring districts.Ethanol productionIndia’s ethanol production is currently 400 crore litres. This year, it’s likely to go up to 550 crore litres as against a basic requirement of 4,000 crore litres.The government, Mr. Gadkari said, was working on biofuel and alternate fuel to save on India’s huge oil import bill, besides acting as a bulwark for the greening of the automobile industry.Flex engines“We have taken a decision to use flex engines in two, three and four wheelers,” Mr. Gadkari said. Flex engines can use petrol or bio ethanol, which will reduce the demand for petrol, he said, adding that automobile manufacturers are in a position to launch flex engine vehicles in the market.The turnover of the automobile industry is ₹7.5 lakh crore, of which ₹3.5 lakh crore are exports. “Within five years, the size of this industry will grow to ₹15 lakh crore, and this is the industry which is giving the maximum employment potential and revenue to the States and Centre. So, this can be a great driving force behind the growth of India, and the automobile industry is the future. I am expecting the Indian automobile industry to become the No. 1 manufacturing hub in the world,” he said.On vehicle scrappage, the Minister said that the country needs at least one scrapping centre in each district and two-three centres in some of districts.The most important part of the scrapping policy is that it will reduce the import of aluminium and copper. “By scrapping, we can get steel, aluminium and copper at very low rates by which we can reduce the cost of components by 25-30%. That is a great advantage to Indian automobile industry,” Mr. Gadkari said."

Police have termed the death as suicide due to depression over personal reasons.Mr. Yadav questioned the circumstances under which Ms. Rashmi Yadav had to allegedly take her own life. Citing information from local sources, Mr. Yadav alleged that there was “political pressure” at the Mohanganj police station where the woman officer was posted. “The government which would accuse others that work is going on as per caste, you can take a look at U.P. from one end to another — aren’t people from the CM’s caste posted there? Are people from the CM’s caste not meting out injustice,” Mr. Yadav asked.He said the district police chief as well as the station officer belonged to the same Kshatriya community.Later, in a tweet, Mr. Yadav raised the caste factor again, alleging that it was sad and condemnable the way in which a woman sub-inspector of a “backward caste” was compelled to commit suicide after harassment by police officers belonging to a “dominant caste.” The former U..P CM demanded that the courts take cognizance of the case, suspend those responsible and conduct a probe.Amethi police said the post-mortem report found asphyxia due to ante-mortem hanging as the reason for the death. Police said as per prima facie analysis of call details and call recording of the deceased in her phone prior to her death, the reason behind the incident appears to be depression caused to by incidents in her personal life."

        "Decrypting the crypto myth\nPremium": "Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are generally perceived as assets, currencies or both. As impactful as cryptocurrencies’ have been as tools of speculation in current financial markets, the narrative behind the existing technology holds the key to breaking it and most fads down.Cryptocurrencies are computer-managed ledger entries that can function as money if someone is willing to value these entries as money and use them in transactions.Cryptocurrencies inherently possess no value whatsoever, but are valued at high prices. The reason why cryptocurrencies are the behemoth instruments seen today lies in the narratives propagated surrounding them.The primary narrative which appeals to most cryptocurrency enthusiasts is the idea that cryptocurrencies, due to some advanced technical brilliance, excel as a currency compared with a dull old currency note.Moreover, the benefits boasted by Bitcoin (the most prominent cryptocurrency) promoters are anonymity and security. Additionally, the use case of Bitcoin (and other cryptocurrencies) involves it being used as a currency to purchase goods and services.Finally, Bitcoin is promoted as a financial asset which can be used as a storehouse of value analogous to gold.Furthermore, Bitcoin is said to function in the same vein as gold because it is limited in numbers and not a productive asset.As we have seen in recent times, Bitcoin and its peers fail to deliver on any of the promises so proudly boasted on the packaging.For a currency to be a viable medium of exchange, the primary requirement is for it to be relatively stable in value.Bitcoin has spectacularly failed in this respect, falling more than 56% over six months (at the time of writing this piece).Moreover, it has also been unable to weather an interest rate increase of merely 1.75%, while the U.S. Federal Reserve has promised further stiff hikes to curb inflation.Bitcoin vs goldGold, in comparison with Bitcoin, has been able to hold its own. Gold has been a mainstay in human society for millennia. However, like Bitcoin, it also derives a significant portion of value from the price people place on it (apart from the other use cases gold has, for example in electronics).Bitcoin proponents’ claim of supposed anonymity and untraceability has been falsified in multiple instances in which governments have tracked criminal activity and recovered stolen Bitcoins.An added defence by Bitcoin enthusiasts is quoting British economist Henry Dunning Macleod’s idea of Gresham’s law, which states that bad money (or money with lower intrinsic value) drives out good money (or money with higher inherent value). Gresham’s law implies that people eventually hoard money with greater intrinsic value (supposedly Bitcoin) and only use bad money (this label is generally assigned to fiat currencies). However, this claim has also been falsified as Bitcoin buyers were quick on the uptake to sell their holdings in exchange for fiat currency in the face of a loss of value.The question is, if all the narrative elements of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies range from shaky at best, to blatantly false, how has it so effectively permeated general society?The answer lies in how most bubbles and financial narratives spread through society. The speculative nature of Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies is undeniable. Most of the small-time investors lured into buying and holding cryptocurrencies are those looking to profit from the massive surge in Bitcoin price by more than 400% from the year 2020-21. It is challenging to deal with the fear of missing out, popularly termed FOMO.Information cascadeWhen one sees their peers make money, it is hard to resist the urge to mimic their actions. The accompanying effect of faulty decision-making is called an ‘information cascade’.An information cascade causes people to value the judgment and actions of others in contrast to their own. Furthermore, Bitcoin and other cryptocurrency trading applications have been heavily advertised before significant sports events such as the IPL and endorsed by popular Bollywood stars whom people idolise. These apps also let the retail investor take on leverage, which has caused many people to lose their savings and more.The way to escape viral financial narratives and fads as a small-time investor is to heed the advice of timeless advice provided in the famous book ‘The richest man in Babylon’ by George S. Clason.One of the most important rules from the book is to avoid investment opportunities which promise you supposedly great returns in a relatively short period.The efficacy of the Bitcoin narrative was in the idea that the prices would keep rising and that the investor, no matter what the scenario was, would stand to gain a tidy profit. Additionally, another rule which the investor Warren Buffet also says is to avoid investment opportunities which you do not inherently understand well. Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies are just another brick in the wall of the countless previous narratives which have spread and collapsed in the history of financial markets.(Anand Srinivasan is a financial consultant, Sashwath Swaminathan is a research associate at Aionion investment services)"

        "Suryakumar making his enormous talent count": "When men like Brian Lara and Ricky Ponting praise a batter, he has to be special. The West Indies legend was impressed by Suryakumar Yadav quite some time before he made his international debut.“Has he played for India?” Lara asked his colleagues in the commentary box during the 2019 IPL. Ponting sees a bit of A.B. de Villiers in Suryakumar. He said as much a few weeks ago, while talking of batters of the 360-degree kind. It is not just the way Suryakumar bats that makes him stand out. It is also the way he responds to different situations.On Wednesday at the Greenfield Stadium here against South Africa in the first T20I, he came in after India recorded its lowest PowerPlay score. Granted that the target was just 107, but the wicket wasn’t easy to bat on, and there was enough for the bowlers, particularly South Africa’s world-class pace attack.Suryakumar’s response to the challenge was simple: he sent the second and third balls he faced, from Anrich Nortje, for six — one a top-edge and the other a typically gorgeous wristy flick over square-leg. He went on to make an unbeaten 33-ball 50 to take India home, his second match-winning innings in a row. K.L. Rahul, with whom he added 93 for the unfinished third wicket, said that his job was made easier by Suryakumar’s aggressive approach. The Mumbai batter now has the record for most runs — 732 — by an Indian in a calendar year, beating Shikhar Dhawan’s mark (689). Not surprisingly, he is also heading the batting chart in T20Is this year. His T20I record — 976 runs at a strike-rate of 173.35 and an average of 39.04 — is not bad for someone who had to wait for more than a decade to earn his India cap after making his First Class debut. India will want those statistics to look even better after the T20 World Cup in Australia. Fans will want that swagger to continue."

The PSU had produced 353.4 MT in the April-November period of the last financial year. Coal India Ltd. (CIL) which accounts for over 80% of domestic coal output is eyeing a production of 700 million tonnes (MT) in the current financial year. \"This is achievable\", said a senior official of CIL. The coal behemoth has to produce 287.4 MT of coal during the remaining four months of the current fiscal to reach its output target for the current fiscal. \"With strong augmentation in production so far and overburden removal displaying robust growth that helps in faster extraction of coal in the coming months, we feel confident of surpassing the fiscal's production target. Also, during Q4 production steps up into a higher trajectory,\" the official added. The PSU produced 60.7 MT of coal last month, registering a growth of 12.8% over the corresponding month of previous fiscal. The supply of coal by CIL to power plants was at 380.7 MT during April-November period, registering a growth of 11.6%. Total coal off-take to all consuming sectors was 445 MT till November.

XBB.1.5 has been driving COVID-19 cases in the U.S. Studies of the strain indicate that it is highly transmissible and evades pre-existing immunity. Yet it doesn’t seem to cause severe disease. But U.S. scientist Eric Topol wrote that it isn’t just superficially scary and we need to pay attention to it. The global prevalence of XBB.1.5 isn’t clear yet, although its parent strain has been detected in at least 35 countries. By December 30, XBB.1.5 accounted for 40.5% of all new cases in the U.S., up from 21.7% a week earlier.How did the variant begin? XBB.1.5 is a recombinant, which means its genome is the product of the genomes of two different strains spliced together. This can happen when two strains infect a person at the same time; a recombinant variant is produced as they replicate together. Recombinant strains also arise when existing recombinant strains mutate. Previous recombinants include XD (Delta + Omicron), XE (BA.1 + BA.2), and XBB (BA.2.10.1 + BA.2.75). The XBB strain is descended from BA.2.10.1.1 and BA.2.75.3.1.1.1. It mutated further and became XBB.1.5. XBB.1, which also descended from XBB, accounted for 14% of new cases in India around mid-December 2022."

Hari Kumar said on Friday, adding that the Rafale M has commonality with the Air Force in terms of spares and support. “It will be a decision of the government... Both aircraft are ok. They have proved themselves. Now there will be other issues, like for example, we already have Rafales for the Air Force. There will be commonality of spare parts and support, etc. Each has got its own strengths and weaknesses,” Adm. Kumar said on the sidelines of the Raisina Dialogue. The dialogue, jointly organised by the Observer Research Foundation and the Ministry of External Affairs, concluded on Friday. An indigenous Twin Engine Deck-Based Fighter (TEDBF) is under development by the Aeronautical Development Agency under the DRDO to operate off the Navy’s aircraft carriers. The 26 jets planned to be procured from abroad will fill the gap in the interim as the existing MiG-29Ks may not last till then. Adm. Kumar said the Navy may get the TEDBF by 2034 or so. Adm. Kumar was speaking at a session on the “future of warfare” that saw the participation of several chiefs of Navy from other countries. Maritime domain challenges were not just traditional and non-traditional, but also transnational, he stated. While all countries may not agree on some issues, most come together on others as part of issue-based convergence, he said. Referring to regional groups in the Indo-Pacific, Adm. Kumar said, “When we work in small groups, it serves a lot of purposes, generates a lot of trust among partner countries, builds capacities, increases interoperability and better domain awareness.” Also on the panel were Gen. Koji Yamazaki, Chief of Staff, Japan Ground Self-Defence Force; Adm. John C. Aquilino, Commander of the U.S. Indo-Pacific Command; Adm. Sir Ben Key, First Sea Lord and Chief of Naval Staff of the U.K. and Vice Adm. Angus Topshee, Commander of Royal Canadian Navy. Adm. Aquilino said that the benefit of Artificial Intelligence in the short-term is decision-making in real-time. “However, it’s important not to lose sight that the military has a human dimension and interaction as the world moves towards AI and machine learning,” he cautioned.  On similar lines, Adm. Key said that AI could crunch data faster than a human. However, it wasn’t capable of human instinct, intuitiveness and understanding of risk, he noted. Gen. Yamazaki noted that cyber space and outer space were two important domains of the future. “Japan is working towards building comprehensive defence capabilities to become secure and resilient in this regard,” he said. Noting that fundamentally naval operations remained the same, Vice Adm. Topshee said that Canada was working with its allies on a range of issues. “The opportunity to interact with other Navies provides us access to various perspectives to formulate a comprehensive way forward,” he added."

Experienced all-rounder Shakib Al Hasan’s unavailability was another blow. Looking forward, the Chandrakant Pandit-coached side has signed Jason Roy for ₹ 2.8 crore. The Englishman will join the squad in Ahmedabad. For its home encounter, KKR would take heart from the way it challenged PBKS while chasing a 190-plus target at Mohali. The host’s batting will revolve around captain Nitish Rana, Venkatesh Iyer, Afghan wicketkeeper-batter Rahmanullah Gurbaz and Caribbean big-hitting all-rounder Andre Russell. KKR’s bowling is armed with pacers Tim Southee and Umesh Yadav and the spin duo of Sunil Narine and Varun Chakravarthy. On a pitch that may offer something for the batters and the speedsters, KKR bowlers need to contain the strong RCB batting line-up, including the fearsome pair of Virat Kohli and Faf du Plessis – who outsmarted Mumbai Indians at home – and Dinesh Karthik. All-rounders Glenn Maxwell, Michael Bracewell and Shahbaz Ahmed provide RCB the balance and complement its potent attack, comprising Mohammad Siraj, ‘home boy’ Akash Deep, Harshal Patel and Karn Sharma. RCB must march ahead without its injured players, pacer Reece Topley and batter Rajat Patidar. "

        "‘India, Tanzania begin trade settlements in local currencies’": "External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar on July 8 said that India and Tanzania have started trade settlements in local currencies and this new initiative will help in promoting commerce between the two countries.Addressing industry leaders at a function, the Minister said India-Tanzania bilateral trade has seen very strong growth, and stood at $6.4 billion in 2022-23. “Now, bear in mind, this is not only a very substantial bilateral trade, but it’s also actually a bilateral trade, which is getting increasingly balanced. Many new products are being added to the trade basket... India remains the biggest destination for Tanzanian exports,” he said.“There’s also an issue which has been brought up from time to time, which is the possibility of trade settlements in our own currencies,” Mr. Jaishankar said. “And I want to share with you that the India central bank has cleared such a possibility. So the three Indian banks, which are here, have that ability to do trade settlements in each other’s currencies. \"I am told few transactions have already taken place in Indian rupees and Tanzanian shillings, and certainly this will provide an additional mechanism to promote trade between our two countries,\" he said. Bank of India, Bank of Baroda, and Canara Bank have operations in Tanzania. Last year, the Reserve Bank of India and Indian Finance Ministry asked the top management of banks and representatives of trade bodies to push export and import transactions in rupee. They want banks in India to connect with their foreign counterparts for opening special rupee vostro accounts to facilitate cross-border trade in the Indian currency rather than the popular mode of the U.S. dollar. About 18 countries have already opened special vostro accounts with Indian banks. On India-Africa economic ties, the minister said India's trade is $98 billion with Africa. \"India's investments are $75 billion, and we are expecting both this trade with Africa and investments in Africa to grow, and I certainly, so agree with what you said, which is that now that there is a pan-African larger continental free trade arrangement in the making, as it unfolds, I think it makes it easier to both trade with Africa and invest in Africa,\" he said.Mr. Jaishankar also stressed on frequent exchanges of business delegations to promote economic cooperation between the two countries. He noted that in 2022, eight big exhibitions in different sectors took place in Tanzania. Earlier in the day, Jaishankar inaugurated a bust of Swami Vivekananda at India's cultural centre in Dar es Salaam. "

        "Pakistan President Alvi dissolves Parliament at PM Shehbaz Sharif’s advice": "Pakistan President Arif Alvi dissolved the National Assembly on August 9 at outgoing Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif’s advice, marking an end to the current government’s tenure and paving the way for next general elections.The notification for the dissolution of the Parliament was issued by the Aiwan-i-Sadr, which said the National Assembly was dissolved under Article 58 of the Constitution.Pakistan Prime Minister Sharif on Wednesday wrote to President Alvi and sought dissolution of the National Assembly three days before the end of its five-year constitutional term.President Arif Alvi dissolved the National Assembly at midnight on Wednesday at outgoing Prime Minister Sharif’s advice, the Dawn newspaper reported.With the dissolution of the Lower House, the current government’s tenure will also end prematurely.Later, Parliamentary Affairs Minister Murtaza Javed Abbasi said in a statement that “the elected government has completed its five-year term”, and his Ministry had forwarded the summary for the dissolution of the assembly to the Prime Minister under Article 58 of the Constitution.Earlier on Thursday, the Prime Minister also chaired the final meeting of the federal cabinet in Islamabad.In his farewell address at the National Assembly on Wednesday, Mr. Sharif said: “Tonight, with the permission of the House, I will send the advice for the dissolution of the National Assembly to the president.” The Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N)-led coalition government would have liked to remain in power for a couple of more days and dissolve Parliament on August 11 but it believes that President Alvi, a former leader of jailed former Prime Minister and cricketer-turned-politician Imran Khan’s Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party, might refuse to issue a notification immediately for the dissolution.The advice from Prime Minister Sharif for the dissolution was sent to President Alvi three days before the term of the Lower House of Parliament expires. President Alvi could have delayed it for 48 hours and after that it would have stood dissolved.Since the assembly has been dissolved before time, the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) would hold elections within 90 days. If the National Assembly had completed its constitutional term, the polls would have been held within 60 days, but in case of dissolution before time, the elections should be held within 90 days.Editorial | Stifling dissent: On Imran Khan’s arrest and Pakistan’s democracy The polls are expected to be delayed for a couple of months as new census results have been approved, which makes it a constitutional obligation to carry out delimitation before elections.The ECP is bound to carry out delimitation within 120 days and then announce the election schedule.Though it is technically possible to expedite the process and determine delimitation of constituencies in minimum time and then go for elections within 90 days, it is not clear if the ECP would follow the deadline as it has a valid reason to overshoot the deadline.“On the completion of the incumbent government’s term, I would send a summary to the President of Pakistan for dissolution of the National Assembly by Wednesday (and then an interim government will take over,” Prime Minister Sharif said on Tuesday while addressing a ceremony.The outgoing Assembly was the 15th National Assembly which began its five-year journey on August 13, 2018, with the election of a Speaker and Deputy Speaker. The Assembly was elected after an election held on July 25, 2018.After the dissolution of the National Assembly, a process to appoint a caretaker prime minister will begin under Article 224-A of the Constitution.Prime Minister Sharif and Leader of the Opposition in the National Assembly Raja Riaz will hold consultations to finalise the name of the interim prime minister.If they failed to agree on the name within three days, the matter will go to the parliamentary committee for the appointment of caretaker Prime Minister.Under the law, the premier and the Opposition leader will send their respective names for the coveted post to the parliamentary committee.The parliamentary committee will have to finalise the name of the caretaker Prime Minister within three days or if it too failed to reach a consensus on the name, then the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) will pick the caretaker PM within two days from the names proposed by the Opposition and the government.In a statement issued on Wednesday, the PTI core committee decided to commemorate the day, as the 16-month tenure of the Pakistan Democratic Movement (PDM) government ends tonight.The PTI has decided to put forth a detailed analysis of the “devastation” caused by the PDM-led incompetent government before the nation, read the statement."

Rahul included in Shreyas’ place at the last minute. It is understood that Shreyas hurt his back soon after the team huddle. Rahul was seen accompanying Shreyas who struggled to walk on the way back to the dressing room.Shreyas’s back injury poses a serious challenge to the batter and the team. After all, the prime choice for the No. 4 slot for the World Cup returned to competitive cricket only last week after a seven-month layoff owing to a back injury. Shreyas had been managing his sore back for the better part of the last 18 months.

        "Biden backs Ukraine, warns against allowing Putin to win": "U.S. President Joe Biden told President Volodymyr Zelenskyy that the U.S. will not abandon Ukraine in its desperate fight against Russia, even as Republicans signaled opposition to extending U.S. war funding.Standing alongside the Ukrainian leader at a White House press conference, Mr. Biden vowed: \"I will not walk away from Ukraine and neither will the American people.\"And he said that allowing a Ukrainian defeat would mean Russian President Vladimir Putin \"and would-be aggressors everywhere will be emboldened.\"Mr. Zelenskyy, who spent the morning talking to Republicans and Democrats in Congress, signalled cautious optimism that the stalled U.S. aid flow will restart.\"I got the signals. They were more than positive. But we know that we have to separate words and particular results. Therefore we will count on particular results,\" Mr. Zelenskyy said.But the united front at the White House contrasted with growing division up on Capitol Hill, where leading Republicans are insisting that renewing Ukraine aid will depend on Democrats first agreeing to major immigration reforms — and even questioning whether the war against Russian invasion should continue.As Moscow claimed fresh battlefield advances and predicted any new assistance for Kyiv would be a \"fiasco,\" Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson expressed little enthusiasm for approving Mr. Biden's request for $60 billion in new assistance.\"What the Biden administration seems to be asking for is billions of additional dollars with no appropriate oversight, no clear strategy to win, and none of the answers that I think the American people are owed,\" Johnson told reporters after meeting Zelensky.Republican Senator JD Vance -- who is close to the party's leader and likely 2024 presidential candidate, Donald Trump -- said on social media that Zelensky was \"gross\" for pressuring the Senate.Russia pounds UkraineThe Kremlin echoed Republican arguments, scoffing at the impact of U.S. support.\"It is important for everyone to understand: the tens of billions of dollars pumped into Ukraine did not help it gain success on the battlefield,\" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Tuesday.And Russia said it was pressing ahead on the ground, just as Ukraine's freezing winter deepens and Moscow's air attacks on Ukraine's cities increase.Ukraine said Russia had launched a \"massive offensive\" with armored vehicles in another part of the front near Avdiivka in the east. In a blow felt by civilians behind the frontlines, Ukraine's main mobile operator said it had been paralyzed by a \"powerful hacker attack.\"- Huge Russian losses -The United States said that in reality, Russia is paying an extraordinary price for small gains, with some 315,000 Russian troops killed or wounded in Ukraine since the war began in February 2022. Russian forces have also lost some 2,200 of the 3,500 tanks they had before the start of the conflict, according to a declassified US intelligence assessment shared with Congress.The White House said Russia had suffered more than 13,000 dead and wounded in the east of Ukraine just since October.But \"Russia seems to believe that a military deadlock through the winter will drain Western support for Ukraine and ultimately give Russia the advantage despite Russian losses,\" National Security Council spokeswoman Adrienne Watson said.As the United States ponders its future Ukraine policy, Polish prime minister-designate Donald Tusk called for \"full mobilization on the part of the free world, the West, in support of Ukraine.\""
