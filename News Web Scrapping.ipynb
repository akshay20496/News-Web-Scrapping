      "NEW DELHI: Gamers are fanatics, hooked virtually for life. But gaming need not be confined to only pushing buttons and keeping scores â€” it''s a serious business opportunity that needs to be tapped. When an enthralled audience is on hand, why haven''t the advertisers answered to the ''call of duty''?In FIFA 2005 (PC game), for example, the virtual teams wear real logos â€” the Arsenal team jerseys have O2 (UK mobile operator and the official sponsor of the team) on them and the Liverpool team ''wears'' Carlsberg beer.While FIFA gamers score amid virtual cheer, the real brands score subliminally.\"Downtown Derby is a game about a pizza delivery girl skating through city streets, collecting Pizza Hut brownie points. I love pizzas, I love games,\" says Gauri Chopra, a gaming devotee. She has a good appetite for pizzas and relishes the game all the more. Like an extra topping!Studies have concluded that gamers respond favourably to the ads they identify with. Advertisements add to the realism of players'' gaming experience.And marketers need not limit themselves to PC and console games alone. Cellphones could provide revolutionary gaming experiences and hold enormous potential for building brand loyalties. But there are many issues that need to be resolved first. \"Advertising is becoming increasingly about exploiting new technology. But there are client concerns about investing in the new media and of developing appropriate gaming content,\" says Nitin Jain of Mindshare India, a media-buying house.Tapping into highly interactive settings may be strongly appealing but marketers are shying away due to uncertainty over target groups, ad delivery mechanisms and limitations in measuring consumer response.\"Anything and everything is an opportunity today,\" says an industry official, on the prospects to advertise through new media. The challenge is in identifying the brand and the groups to target. \"The client has to be convinced about the returns on their investments,\" he adds.The animated gaming industry, pegged at $300 million by a recent Nasscom study, stands to reap maximum benefits. \"Games can become very popular and personalised if users see their character/brand in the background,\" says Prafull Gade, operation heads, Escotoonz Entertainment, a Faridabad-based animation firm.But there are sceptics all around, who may keep the pace of ''advergaming'' a bit slow for now. Says Gade: \"In India, there are only a few companies willing to spend large sums on games around their brand as compared to other media.\"Advergaming is a heady combo with few takers yet, although it is bound to boom soon. Little did A S Douglas, creator of the first computer game, a version of Tic-Tac-Toe, or William Higginbotham, creator of the first video game, realise what advertising could possibly do with gaming. Experts say that the future is bright and animated. After all, it is estimated that by 2006, 529 million people across the world will play games on mobiles, online and through interactive TV. \n"

      "INDORE: A revision petition challenging a local court order that not standing at attention during National Anthem cannot be considered as an 'obstruction', was filed in the district and sessions court on Saturday. Challenging the order in the court of district and session judge, the counsel for the Tiranga Abhiyan, a non-governmental organisation, urged the court it will be a \"serious legal mistake\" to treat a person sitting during the National Anthem as not obstruction.The counsel Shailendra Dwivedi said in the prevention of insult to the National Honour Act of 1971, it has been stated any obstruction during rendition of the National Anthem is a \"disrespect\" to the Anthem. He said the lower court has not considered as obstruction while dismissing a petition against Railway Minister Lalu Prasad and Bihar Chief Minister Rabri Devi for being seated at the time of the playing of the National Anthem. The Act has not described the \"reasons for obstructions\" and in that scenario the ruling of the lower court \"is a serious legal mistake,\" Dwivedi said in his petition. \"If sitting and reading of a person is not an obstruction, when the other persons were standing in an attention position during the National Anthem, then other activities too like lying down, sleeping and eating will not be treated as obstruction during the National Anthem,\" he said. Since the country is independent, it is the moral duty of every person to stand in the honour of the National Anthem and is more important for those occupying high posts in the country as people emulate them and their acts as role model, Dwivedi said. He prayed to the court to quash the lower court order by taking cognizance of the facts mentioned in the petition on its merits. The petition was filed on the basis of a photograph published in an eveninger on January 5, showing the couple sitting, while others were standing at attention when National Anthem was played at a function in Bihar. The court has fixed February 7, as the next date of hearing in the case.\n"

      "MUMBAI: A daring jewellery heist executed by a band of nine robbers at a Kandivli firm more than a year ago was solved by the police on Sunday. However, the stolen sum of Rs 25 lakh remained untraced.Senior police officers said the gang was tipped off by a disgruntled employee working with the same firm. In exchange, he was offered a sizeable share of the loot. The police are likely to apply the stringent MCOCA on the gang for operating as an organised crime syndicate.A jeweller based in an industrial estate at Kandivli's Iraniwadi had been looted on May 11, 2005. Four robbers had scaled the building at night and broken the entrance grill to enter the office on the first floor before decamping with the valuables. The loot included ornaments and gold worth Rs 23 lakh. The robbers had been armed with revolvers and choppers.For a year, the cops were unable to trace the culprits......The case was even discussed in the state assembly. Finally, they zeroed in on an employee of the firm who did not seem happy with the management. \"The employee, Arun Dhakwe, claimed he hadn't been paid Rs 40,000 by the firm's owner. When he found that gold ornaments were going to be stored in the office, he tipped off the gang of robbers, to seek revenge,\" said a police officer. Dhakwe was offered Rs 90,000 from the loot while the rest was distributed amongst gang members.Police said the heist was plotted by notorious robber, Arun Avdesh Singh alias Babu, who is one of the most wanted criminals in Mumbai police's records. Babu, alongwith four others who were involved in post-robbery operations, are wanted.The arrested accused have been identified as Santosh Swami (22), Rupesh Singh (25) and Deepak Kambli (29). Three of them were arrested by the crime branch.Explore Your Financial Landscape with Personalized Credit Insights.\n"

      "Landslide kills at least seven on Italy's Ischia island\n",
      "CASAMICCIOLA TERME (ITALY): At least seven people, including a newborn and two children, were killed on the southern Italian holiday island of Ischia after a landslide caused by torrential rain devastated a small town here, an official said on Sunday. Five people were still missing, Naples prefect Claudio Palomba told a news conference. Dozens of emergency workers rushed to the island while rescue divers searched the waters off the coast, he said. A wave of mud, debris and stones broke away from the island's highest mountain on Saturday and crashed down over houses and roads in and around the town of Casamicciola Terme. Photographs and aerial video showed buildings smashed by the landslide and several cars pushed into the sea by what one resident described as \"a waterfall of water and mud\". Densely populated, Ischia is a volcanic island which lies some 30 km (19 miles) from Naples. It draws visitors to its thermal baths and picturesque coastline. Episodes of heavy rainfall are becoming more common and more intense in the light of climate change, experts say, exacerbating hydrogeological risks in many parts of Italy. Statistics show Ischia has a large number of houses that were built illegally, putting inhabitants at permanent risk from flooding and earthquakes - which have often hit the hilly island over the past years. The fatal landslide has reignited political controversy over pardons for unlawful buildings granted in recent decades and the reluctance of some politicians to address the issue. \"People must understand that they can't live in some areas and buildings in risky areas must be torn down,\" Campania governor Vincenzo De Luca told state broadcaster RAI on Sunday. Italy's new right-wing government led by Giorgia Meloni held a cabinet meeting on Sunday and issued a decree aimed at providing swift help to people in need following the disaster, including some 230 people who were evacuated. The decree earmarked an initial aid package of 2 million euros ($2.08 million) and envisaged a suspension of tax payments for residents until the end of the year.\n"

       "'NEW DELHI: Indian citizenship would not be granted to any foreigner without the consent of state governments concerned after the passage of the Citizenship (Amendment) Bill, the Home Ministry said on Tuesday.Ministry spokesperson Ashok Prasad said every application for Indian citizenship will be enquired into by the deputy commissioner or district magistrate concerned, who will carry out due diligence and submit it to the state government concerned.\"The state government also has to conduct an enquiry through its agencies. Only then, an individual will be granted Indian nationality. Without the state government\\'s recommendations, no one will be given Indian citizenship,\" Prasad told reporters here.The Citizenship Amendment Bill 2019, being strongly opposed by a large section of people and organisations in the Northeast, seeks to provide Indian citizenship to persecuted minorities -- Hindus, Sikhs, Jains, Buddhists and Christians -- from Bangladesh, Pakistan and Afghanistan after they have stayed in India for seven years, instead of 12 years at present. This is applicable to those who came to India before December 31, 2014.The six religious minorities from Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan were earlier given a special dispensation for grant of long term visas.People belonging to Hindu, Sikh, Buddhism, Jain, Parsi and Christian religions from Pakistan, Bangladesh, Afghanistan will have to prove they belonged to any of the three countries and were persecuted on religious lines among other things for Indian citizenship.A large section of people and organisations in the Northeast have opposed the Bill saying it will nullify the provisions of the Assam Accord of 1985, which fixed March 24, 1971 as the cut-off date for deportation of all illegal immigrants irrespective of religion.There have been sporadic protests against the Bill in the region ever since it was introduced and passed in the Lok Sabha on January 8.Home Minister Rajnath Singh has already said the Bill will apply to all States and Union Territories and the beneficiaries can reside anywhere in the country.\"The burden of these persecuted migrants will be shared by the whole country. Assam alone would not have to bear the entire burden and the government is committed to giving all help to the state government and people of Assam,\" Singh had said.Home Ministry sources said the ministry is considering a proposal to provide incentives to those people who want to settle anywhere in India, except the Northeast.'"

The launch price of Rs 9.69 lakh, ex-showroom for the base variant was an introductory price limited only till 31 December 2019, said Kia Motor India, the Indian arm of Korean carmaker.Kia was not the only manufacturer to hike prices from January. Automobile manufacturers conventionally raise prices around the beginning of every new year to incentivise customers into purchasing older vehicles before the model-year changes and their value takes a hit.Maruti Suzuki, Mahindra & Mahindra (M&M), Ford India, Toyota Kirloskar Motor (TKM), Mercedes Benz and Audi India were some of the other manufacturers who hiked prices of their vehicles starting this new year, ET had reported earlier. The price hikes were to counter inflationary pressure, they said.The price hikes were anywhere in the range of 1-3%.Kia Motors, meanwhile, is gearing up for the launch of its second vehicle in India – the Carnival multi-purpose vehicle. The premium MPV will be launched at the New Delhi Auto Expo in February.Kia Motors India has an installed capacity to manufacture 300,000 vehicles annually at its facility in Anantapur, Andhra Pradesh. It has set up a network of 265 customer touchpoints across 160 tier 1, 2 and 3 cities in the country.'"

      "LONDON: Venkatraman Ramakrishnan, India-born US citizen whose pioneering work in molecular biology won him the 2009 Nobel Prize in chemistry, has been honoured with a knighthood by the royal establishment here in a rare recognition of achievements by foreigners based in Britain.58-year-old Ramakrishnan, known to most as Venky, is based at the MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology in Cambridge.He has been conferred knighthood \"for services to molecular biology\" in the New Year Honours List 2012, according to an official announcement here.After the list was released early today, Ramakrishnan said that honouring him with a knighthood reflects the contribution made by immigrants to British society.In a statement to PTI, he said: \"In the current debate about immigration, it is worth noting that this award is yet another example of the numerous contributions that immigrants make to British society.\"\"Indeed, many of the founding members of the Laboratory of Molecular Biology were immigrants themselves, and they helped to revolutionise modern biology.\"Ramakrishnan said: \"This is an honour that reflects the quality of science supported by the Medical Research Council, in particular at the Laboratory of Molecular Biology in Cambridge. In my case, credit should go to the numerous dedicated postdocs, students, associates and colleagues who made crucial contributions to the work.\"It is rare for foreign citizens to be honoured with knighthoods.Such individuals do not use the style 'Sir', but are often called 'Sir' in popular parlance, such as 'Sir Garfield Sobers' in the case of the legendary West Indies cricketer\n"

      "U.S. President Joe Biden told President Volodymyr Zelenskyy that the U.S. will not abandon Ukraine in its desperate fight against Russia, even as Republicans signaled opposition to extending U.S. war funding.Standing alongside the Ukrainian leader at a White House press conference, Mr. Biden vowed: \"I will not walk away from Ukraine and neither will the American people.\"And he said that allowing a Ukrainian defeat would mean Russian President Vladimir Putin \"and would-be aggressors everywhere will be emboldened.\"Mr. Zelenskyy, who spent the morning talking to Republicans and Democrats in Congress, signalled cautious optimism that the stalled U.S. aid flow will restart.\"I got the signals. They were more than positive. But we know that we have to separate words and particular results. Therefore we will count on particular results,\" Mr. Zelenskyy said.But the united front at the White House contrasted with growing division up on Capitol Hill, where leading Republicans are insisting that renewing Ukraine aid will depend on Democrats first agreeing to major immigration reforms — and even questioning whether the war against Russian invasion should continue.As Moscow claimed fresh battlefield advances and predicted any new assistance for Kyiv would be a \"fiasco,\" Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson expressed little enthusiasm for approving Mr. Biden's request for $60 billion in new assistance.\"What the Biden administration seems to be asking for is billions of additional dollars with no appropriate oversight, no clear strategy to win, and none of the answers that I think the American people are owed,\" Johnson told reporters after meeting Zelensky.Republican Senator JD Vance -- who is close to the party's leader and likely 2024 presidential candidate, Donald Trump -- said on social media that Zelensky was \"gross\" for pressuring the Senate.Russia pounds UkraineThe Kremlin echoed Republican arguments, scoffing at the impact of U.S. support.\"It is important for everyone to understand: the tens of billions of dollars pumped into Ukraine did not help it gain success on the battlefield,\" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Tuesday.And Russia said it was pressing ahead on the ground, just as Ukraine's freezing winter deepens and Moscow's air attacks on Ukraine's cities increase.Ukraine said Russia had launched a \"massive offensive\" with armored vehicles in another part of the front near Avdiivka in the east. In a blow felt by civilians behind the frontlines, Ukraine's main mobile operator said it had been paralyzed by a \"powerful hacker attack.\"- Huge Russian losses -The United States said that in reality, Russia is paying an extraordinary price for small gains, with some 315,000 Russian troops killed or wounded in Ukraine since the war began in February 2022. Russian forces have also lost some 2,200 of the 3,500 tanks they had before the start of the conflict, according to a declassified US intelligence assessment shared with Congress.The White House said Russia had suffered more than 13,000 dead and wounded in the east of Ukraine just since October.But \"Russia seems to believe that a military deadlock through the winter will drain Western support for Ukraine and ultimately give Russia the advantage despite Russian losses,\" National Security Council spokeswoman Adrienne Watson said.As the United States ponders its future Ukraine policy, Polish prime minister-designate Donald Tusk called for \"full mobilization on the part of the free world, the West, in support of Ukraine.\"\n"

      "SundayAn Iranian oil tanker is being reflagged and is preparing to sail to the Mediterranean, Iran's state television reported on Friday, after Gibraltar decided to free the seized ship.\"Based on the owner's request, the oil tanker Grace 1 will depart for the Mediterranean after being reflagged under the Iranian flag and renamed Adrian Darya after preparing for the journey,\" the television quoted Jalil Eslami, deputy head of Iran's Ports and Maritime Organisation, as saying.Britain's Mediterranean territory Gibraltar decided on Thursday to free the Panama-flagged tanker, but did not immediately indicate when or if the ship would set sail after the United States launched a new, last-minute legal bid to hold it.\"The 25-member crew will start their journey after preparations, including refueling,\" Eslami said.The television report did not identify the tanker's owner.The Grace 1 was seized by British Royal Marine commandos off the coast of the territory at the western mouth of the Mediterranean on July 4 on suspicion of violating European Union sanctions by taking oil to Syria, a close ally of Iran.Two weeks later, Iran seized a British-flagged tanker in the Strait of Hormuz leading into the Gulf.The two tankers have become pawns in the standoff between Iran and the West, their fate tangled up in the diplomatic differences between the EU's big powers and the United States.Gibraltar officials did not make clear whether the U.S. legal bid would mean the ship would have to be detained further or, if so, for how long.Iran said the ship would sail shortly and Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif characterised the U.S. bid to prevent it from leaving as \"piracy\".Oil Tanker / IranWhile most comments will be posted if they are on-topic and not abusive, moderation decisions are subjective.

      "An Iranian oil tanker is being reflagged and is preparing to sail to the Mediterranean, Iran's state television reported on Friday, after Gibraltar decided to free the seized ship.\"Based on the owner's request, the oil tanker Grace 1 will depart for the Mediterranean after being reflagged under the Iranian flag and renamed Adrian Darya after preparing for the journey,\" the television quoted Jalil Eslami, deputy head of Iran's Ports and Maritime Organisation, as saying.Britain's Mediterranean territory Gibraltar decided on Thursday to free the Panama-flagged tanker, but did not immediately indicate when or if the ship would set sail after the United States launched a new, last-minute legal bid to hold it.\"The 25-member crew will start their journey after preparations, including refueling,\" Eslami said.The television report did not identify the tanker's owner.The Grace 1 was seized by British Royal Marine commandos off the coast of the territory at the western mouth of the Mediterranean on July 4 on suspicion of violating European Union sanctions by taking oil to Syria, a close ally of Iran.Two weeks later, Iran seized a British-flagged tanker in the Strait of Hormuz leading into the Gulf.The two tankers have become pawns in the standoff between Iran and the West, their fate tangled up in the diplomatic differences between the EU's big powers and the United States.Gibraltar officials did not make clear whether the U.S. legal bid would mean the ship would have to be detained further or, if so, for how long.Iran said the ship would sail shortly and Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif characterised the U.S. bid to prevent it from leaving as \"piracy\".Oil Tanker / IranWhile most comments will be posted if they are on-topic and not abusive, moderation decisions are subjective.

Multiple availability domains within a region will not address this issue,\" said Don Johnson, executive vice president of Oracle Cloud Infrastructure.\"Oracle is committed to offer a second region for disaster recovery in every country where we launch Oracle Cloud Infrastructure services, a strategy that is aligned with our customers' needs,\" he added. Oracle expects to open an average of one region, every 23 days, over the next 15 months, for a total of 20 additional regions, 17 commercial and three government, according to the statement.\n"

      "Lionel Messi has been named Time magazine's \"Athlete of the Year\" for 2023 after a trailblazing season marked by an eighth Ballon d'Or award and his ground-breaking move to Major League Soccer's Inter Miami.Time said the Argentine superstar had already had a transformative impact on the American sporting landscape, which has been historically slow to embrace football.\"Lionel Messi this year managed to do what once seemed impossible, when he signed with Inter Miami: turning the US into a soccer country,\" Time commented.The 36-year-old Messi made his debut for Miami in July following an acrimonious departure from Paris Saint-Germain.The World Cup-winner also rebuffed a lucrative move to Saudi Arabia in favor of a new chapter in MLS.The eight-time Ballon d'Or winner made an instant impact on Miami's fortunes, playing a pivotal role in helping the team win the expanded Leagues Cup, a cross-border competition for teams from MLS and Mexico's top flight.Messi finished the campaign with 11 goals in 14 appearances across all competitions, but an injury towards the end of the season meant he was unable to help Miami force their way into the playoffs.Messi was quoted by Time as saying that his first preference after PSG had been a fairytale return to Barcelona, but that move stalled over the club's finances.\"I tried to return, and it did not happen,\" Messi said, adding that he was also \"thinking a lot\" about joining the wave of overseas players who have headed to the Saudi Pro League.\"It was Saudi Arabia or MLS, and both options seemed very interesting to me,\" Messi told the magazine.Time said Messi's arrival had driven a surge in attendances, ticket prices, merchandise sales and viewership, revealing that on the day of his debut, subscriptions to Apple TV -- which retains exclusive rights to MLS -- had jumped by 110,000, a 1,700% increase over the previous day.\n"

      "Fitness age a better indicator of longevity\n",
      "A new study of fitness and lifespan suggests that a persons so-called fitness age  determined primarily by a measure of cardiovascular endurance  is a better predictor of longevity than chronological age. The good news is that unlike your actual age, your fitness age can decrease.The concept of fitness age has been developed by researchers at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology in Trondheim, who have studied fitness and how it relates to wellness for years.Fitness age is determined primarily by your VO2max, which is a measure of your bodys ability to take in and utilise oxygen. VO2max indicates your current cardiovascular endurance.If your VO2max is below average for your age group, then your fitness age is older than your actual age. But if you compare well, you can actually turn back the clock to a younger fitness age. That means a 50-year-old man conceivably could have a fitness age between 30 and 75, depending on his VO2max.Norwegian scientists decided several years ago to develop an easy method for estimating VO2max. They recruited almost 5,000 Norwegians between the ages of 20 and 90, measured their aerobic capacity with treadmill testing and also checked a variety of health parameters, including waist circumference, heart rate and exercise habits. They then determined that those parameters could, if plugged into an algorithm, provide a very close approximation of someones VO2max.But while fitness age may give you bragging rights about your youthful vigour, the real question is whether it is a meaningful measurement in terms of longevity. In a new study, which was published in June in Medicine & Science in Sports & Exercise, scientists turned to a large trove of data about more than 55,000 Norwegian adults who had completed extensive health questionnaires beginning in the 1980s. The scientists used the volunteers answers to estimate each persons VO2max and fitness age. Then they checked death records.It turned out that people whose calculated VO2max was 85 per cent or more below the average for their age  meaning that their fitness age was significantly above their chronological years  had an 82 per cent higher risk of dying prematurely than those whose fitness age was the same as or more youthful than their actual age. According to the studys authors, the results suggest that fitness age may predict a persons risk of early death better than some traditional risk factors like being overweight, having high cholesterol levels or blood pressure, and smoking.– Gretchen Reynolds\n"

      "In the dozen years between 1957 and 1969, the Americans and the Russians went on a series of space races. The Russians won almost everything at first. They were to first to send a satellite into orbit (Sputnik in 1957), the first to send a living thing into space, the dog Laika in the same year, the first to send a human being into orbit (Yuri Gagarin in 1961). The first person to \"walk\" in space, meaning exit the spacecraft while in orbit, was Aleksey Leonov in 1965. After this the United States registered its first win in 1969 when it was able to land humans on the moon. The US remains the only nation to be able to do this and it last did so in 1972. The Soviet Union tried and failed to develop a large rocket and so the space race virtually ended in the early 1970s. For 50 years, there has been no interest in moon landings with humans because the cost is very high and the American public lost interest.\n",
      "The Space Shuttle programme was seen as a lower-cost, reusable way for America to send its astronauts into orbit and to the International Space Station. However, two disasters, one in the 1980s and another in the early 2000s (in which Kalpana Chawla was killed) and unexpectedly high costs ended the programme over a decade ago. After that, America did not even have the capacity to send humans into orbit, something that changed only in 2020 when a private firm was able to begin its service.\n",
      "Russians still fly rockets based on the same technology that was used in the 1960s, with some modifications, and much of the technology in the space race came from Nazi Germany’s military rocket programme of 90 years ago. The captured scientists on the two fronts were pressed into service by the Americans and the Russians.\n",
      "One reason why space innovation was stagnant for so many decades is that it was funded by governments which were spending large amounts on nationalistic projects. Even today, the budget for Nasa, the US space agency, is $25 billion. Isro’s budget is about $1.5 billion, which makes its achievements over the decades quite remarkable.\n",
      "This changed about 15 years ago, when it became clear that satellite communications, GPS and the Internet, were going to be very big drivers in the economy. Private firms began to take an interest first in developing the technology that would go into satellites and then to build rockets. This second shift happened after the US government funded space start-ups and allowed them, under conditions, to develop rocket technology. As rockets are no different from missiles, their development and manufacturing is tightly controlled. Only American citizens, for instance, can work at these firms. This limits the amount of talent they can absorb but is one way that the government can ensure the technology does not reach what it considers to be the wrong hands.\n",
      "Even with these restrictions, the private sector has breathed new life into the space sector. Another, much smaller, space race began after the US government’s funding between two firms to launch the first human to orbit on a private rocket. Boeing, the giant company, lost out to the younger SpaceX, though it had received more funding than the start-up. Today, the rockets are reusable to a large extent and at least two firms are building giant rockets of the size that existed 50 years ago. The target is two-fold, the first is to lower the cost of space and reduce the cost per kilogram of putting things into orbit. The second is human space flight and attempting to colonise Mars. Imagine what a difference it will make to the world if there is an outpost humans create on another planet. Of course, this will be difficult: Even today in 2023, the number of entities that have sent humans into orbit around the earth is limited to Russia (USSR), the United States, China and the company SpaceX.\n",
      "The winners in the race this time stand to make large amounts of money (SpaceX, which is privately held, is valued at over $100 billion) and also own technology that will help them monopolise space. Efficient rocket engines, new fuels, highly complex aspects of reusability and fuel transfers make this the domain of a very few entities.\n",
      "The cost of launching a satellite runs into hundreds of crores of rupees. The monopoly over space will mean that, particularly on the commercial side, that is to say satellite launches, will be controlled by companies or nations that others will have no option but to go to. Even the UK and Germany today have no launch capacity and are dependent on either private entities or their ally, the United States, to launch satellites.\n",

This is the background in which India is attempting to soft-land a rover on the moon and will attempt, at some point next year hopefully, sending humans into orbit.\n",

Commercial spaceflight is becoming routine.As space travel becomes more common, so does the possibility that someone might die along the way.It brings to mind a gloomy but necessary question to ask: If someone dies in space  what happens to the body?Death on the Moon and MarsAs a space medical doctor who works to find new ways to keep astronauts healthy, I and my team at the Translational Research Institute for Space Health want to make sure space explorers are as healthy as they can be for space missions.Here is how death in space would be handled today: If someone died on a low-Earth-orbit mission  such as aboard the International Space Station  the crew could return the body to Earth in a capsule within a matter of hours.If it happened on the Moon, the crew could return home with the body in just a few days. NASA already has detailed protocols in place for such events.Because of that quick return, it's likely that preservation of the body would not be NASA's major concern; instead, the No. 1 priority would be making sure the remaining crew returns safely to Earth.Things would be different if an astronaut died during the 300 million-mile trip to Mars.In that scenario, the crew probably wouldn't be able to turn around and go back. Instead, the body would likely return to Earth along with the crew at the end of the mission, which would be a couple of years later.In the meantime, the crew would presumably preserve the body in a separate chamber or specialised body bag.The steady temperature and humidity inside the space vehicle would theoretically help preserve the body.But all those scenarios would apply only if someone died in a pressurised environment, like a space station or a spacecraft.What would happen if someone stepped outside into space without the protection of a spacesuit?The astronaut would die almost instantly. The loss of pressure and the exposure to the vacuum of space would make it impossible for the astronaut to breathe, and blood and other body fluids would boil.What would happen if an astronaut stepped out onto the Moon or Mars without a spacesuit?The Moon has nearly no atmosphere  a very tiny amount. Mars has a very thin atmosphere, and almost no oxygen. So the result would be about the same as exposure to open space: suffocation and boiling blood.What about burial? Suppose the astronaut died after landing, while on the surface of Mars.Cremation isn't desirable; it requires too much energy that the surviving crew needs for other purposes.And burial isn't a good idea, either. Bacteria and other organisms from the body could contaminate the Martian surface. Instead, the crew would likely preserve the body in a specialised body bag until it could be returned to Earth.There are still many unknowns about how explorers would deal with a death. It's not just the question of what to do with the body.Helping the crew deal with the loss, and helping the grieving families back on Earth, are just as important as handling the remains of the person who died.But to truly colonise other worlds  whether the Moon, Mars or a planet outside our solar system  this grim scenario will require planning and protocols.\\xa0By Emmanuel Urquieta, Professor of Space Medicine and Emergency Medicine, Baylor College of Medicine (on PTI)\"}\n",

      "{'_id': ObjectId('65945929602e420d83ff4493'), 'A beastly tale': 'Last year, the cow was at the centre of many heated debates in India. As 2016 starts, it is the turn of the bull. Tamil Nadu, which was recently ravaged by floods, is being shaken and stirred now by Jallikattu, or the lack thereof. The traditional \"bull taming\" contest, originally scheduled to start with the Pongal festivities today, has been banned by the Supreme Court.The Jallikattu tale goes back millennia. A specially bred bull is released from a pen into a small arena with garlands, currency and coconuts wreathed around its sharpened horns. Those who dare have to hang on to the hump for about 15-20 metres or three jumps of the bull to win a prize.This aspect of the annual harvest festival, especially popular in southern Tamil Nadu, was first banned by the Supreme Court in 2014, following a plea that it was cruel to the bull. There was no Jallikattu last year. But this is an election year in the state and all political parties want to woo voters by bringing the sport back.So the Central government issued a notification on January 7, allowing Jallikattu in Tamil Nadu and bullock cart racing in Maharashtra — another harvest festivity banned on the same grounds. But the Supreme Court has twisted the tale by staying the notification. Led by chief minister J. Jayalalithaa, all Tamil Nadu politicians were clamouring for a Central ordinance yesterday, to beat the Supreme Court stay.\\xa0On Wednesday, the matter came up again before the top court which rejected a petition to allow Jallikattu.The question here is — Does the sport of Jallikattu inflict unnecessary cruelty on the participating bull? Proponents say no and point out that no bull has died in the ring in living memory, though plenty of people have been injured and some killed. Opponents point out that a bull — especially one bred at home — is not naturally aggressive. Left to itself, it would probably amble from spectator to spectator looking for a banana, as a lawyer said in court.To make such a placid animal aggressive, you have to subject it to extreme cruelty. In its 2014 ruling, the Supreme Court referred to a comprehensive inquiry authorised by the Animal Welfare Board of India. Investigators observed that bulls were forced to participate and were deliberately taunted, tormented, mutilated, stabbed, beaten, chased and denied even their most basic needs, including food, water and sanitation. On many occasions, bulls were forced to drink fluids that were, most likely, liquor. And lemon was squeezed into their eyes and chilli powder rubbed on their genitals.Drunk, maddened by pain and terrified of the large roaring crowd, the bull is quite likely to buck and run, making it all very exciting to machismo lovers and illegal punters alike.That is the tradition under threat from animal rights activists. And it is not just Jallikattu. There is also the bullock cart race in parts of Maharashtra around Pune, where yoked pairs of bullock are forced to race down such narrow ravines that collisions are inevitable.The 2014 Supreme Court judgment said bulls must not be used in any type of performance, including Jallikattu, races or bullfights. The last is important, because bullfights are not confined to Iberia or Latin America. They are also held, illegally, in many villages of Goa under the name of Dhirio. Goa’s lawmakers are now considering a move to legalise it.The same judgment of India’s apex court banned cockfighting, dogfighting and any other staged fights between animals — including between humans and animals — for entertainment. That really set the cat among the bulbuls and roosters.India’s different calendars have different names and slightly different dates for the annual harvest festival — Pongal, Makar Sankranti, Lohri, Magh Bihu — but many of them include animal fights. Newspapers carry stern warnings from policemen in Andhra Pradesh that they will not allow cockfighting. There is a court ban. But traditionalists defy.Assam is in the same situation as Tamil Nadu. It is going to the polls and politicians want to allow bulbul fights this Magh Bihu. The Gauhati\\xa0high court has placed an interim ban and the next hearing is scheduled after Magh Bihu, which is\\xa0tomorrow.It is difficult to imagine bulbuls fighting for anything more than a perch. But they can, especially when bred and trained like roosters that often fight to the death with sharpened beaks, claws and razor blades. And all the while, millions change hands in illegal bets.The bulbul fights are centered around the Hayagriva Madhab Mandir at Hajo, just 35 km from Guwahati across the Brahmaputra. Hundreds of bulbuls are carried to the temple and starved for a couple of days to make them angry. Champion bulbuls of different villages are pitted against each other in knockout rounds. The village that wins can hold its crest high.Dogfights popular in Haryana and Punjab carry similar cachet — the dogs bred and trained for this are aptly named \"bully kuttas\". Loss of skin, ears, eyes and even life is common.There has been a progression of rights in history. Slavery was outlawed, women got the vote, children cannot be beaten or forced to work. Animal rights is the next frontier. India has had the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act since 1960, which states that it is illegal if anyone \"…treats any animal so as to subject it to unnecessary pain or suffering, or being the owner permits, any animal to be so treated\" or if anyone \"solely with a view to providing entertainment… organises, keeps (,) uses or acts in the management (of) any place for animal fighting...\"As with all other rights, tradition is invoked to oppose progress. Animal rights activists say it is critical that people recognise and accept that animal fighting is an atrocity that masquerades as tradition and entertainment.Most of the time, as now, Indian courts have ruled in favour of rights. Now the traditionalists want politicians to legalise their entertainment so that courts cannot intervene. The battle is already being fought across many fronts. On social media channels, the first shots have been fired. Jallikattu supporters argue that it is hypocritical to be simultaneously against the beef ban and Jallikattu. They say non-vegetarians who tacitly condone animal slaughter have no business to oppose animal fights.This argument has been dealt with in the 1960 law on Prevention of Cruelty to Animals. Section 11(3) of this law makes exceptions in five categories under the \"doctrine of necessity\". It permits killing of animals as food as long as there is no inflicting of unnecessary pain or suffering, but entertainment, exhibition or amusement does not fall under any exempted category as the Supreme Court pointed out in 2014. The judgment is clear. Yet animal fights will take place. The battle between man and animal rights will be long.'}\n",

There she had proved an effective draw, her charm and empathy connecting with the masses and drawing praise even from pundits who saw traces of her grandmother Indira Gandhi in her. For Congressmen, she is the brahmastra which will flatten the Opposition. But will it? There’s no guarantee that Priyanka will have the same impact this time, and specially with first-time voters. And while the Gandhi name has traction in Rae Bareli and Amethi, would it have the same impact in other parts of the state? Not necessarily. Indeed, there is a danger that she will be wasted and by drawing her into public life with a low probability of success, her efficacy will be forever finished. Today there is a mystery about her; tomorrow she will be just another campaigner, except for her surname.Roping in Priyanka will have other repercussions, none of them particularly beneficial to the party. Once in, she can’t be just a campaigner; she will have to be involved in the larger decision-making, and thus will get a role in the party. If she is made yet another vice-president, Rahul Gandhi will have to be elevated as president, presuming that Sonia Gandhi assumes some sort of emeritus mantle. This is fraught with complications, as Congress members won’t know who to flock towards and inevitably three power centres will emerge. The Gandhis between them may not have issues but their camp followers will. Undercutting, second-guessing and intrigue, more than seen now, will be the order of the day.And how will this solve any of the fundamental problems that the party faces? It is losing its connect with the people. Priyanka won’t be able to change that overnight. The bigger concern is the party’s structural weaknesses — the lack of inner-party democracy, the almost total disappearance of state-level leaders who have their pulse on the people of their domain, the robust intra-party communications that allows messages to flow up and down. If anything, Priyanka’s elevation will exacerbate those problems since party elections for top posts will become a farce.Though there may have been a clamour from grassroots workers in parts of Uttar Pradesh to bring in Priyanka, the most vociferous advocates are those who have rarely won an election in their lives and now hold prominent positions at the top. They know her advent will once and for all end the farce of inner-party democracy and make their position even stronger. The Gandhi family is not unaware of this. They have been resisting bringing her into the party and in the public eye for a long time. They realise that with the controversies surrounding her husband Robert Vadra, she will become a target of criticism and calumny. The Gandhi-bashing of the BJP, that is now flagging and becoming tedious and clichéd, will get a new lease of life. They have taken a call to let her campaign all over the state, but they know that if the Priyanka card proves to be a damp squib, it could be humiliating.Meanwhile, the brains trust of the party would do well to not just think about how to revive it but to get their hands dirty and go out into the field. Many of today’s Congressmen and women have forgotten its history, but this has always been a party that worked at the lowest rung. There wasn’t, and perhaps still isn’t, a single village without a Congress member and a single district without a committee. That infrastructure could not have fully vanished. If the party wants to get back into contention, it has to look beyond finding the magic cure for its ailments and start rebuilding the organisation, piece by piece. Priyanka is not the answer to the Congress’ problems.'}\n",

Pope Francis, who has been complaining of strained ligaments in his right knee for months, used a wheelchair to preside over the ceremony.In his address, the Pope decried the many wars afflicting the world today and called on leaders to take responsibility.Sadly in the world distances grow and tensions and wars increase, the Pope said, expressing hope that the new saints may inspire solutions of togetherness and ways of dialogue.Especially in the hearts and minds of those who hold positions of great responsibility and are called to be protagonists of peace and not of war, the official Vatican News quoted the Pope as saying.Speaking during the General Audience on March 23, nearly a month after Russia launched a special military operation in Ukraine, the Pope had remarked on how the war in Ukraine shows that humanity had to shed a strange instinct for \"self-destruction\" and that buying more weapons was not the ultimate solution to any conflict.At the beginning of the liturgical celebration, the Pope proclaimed 10 new saints -six men and four women: Titus Brandsma; Lazzarus Devasahayam; Cesar de Bus; Luigi Maria Palazzolo; Giustino Maria Russolillo; Charles de Foucauld; Maria Rivier; Maria Francesca of Jesus Rubatto; Maria of Jesus Santocanale; Maria Domenica Mantovani.A group of Indians holding the tricolour cheered from the gathering when Devasahayam\\'s name was announced.With the completion of the process, Pillai, who took the name \"Lazarus\" after embracing Christianity in 1745, became the first lay person from India to become a saint.Devasahayam was born on April 23, 1712 as Neelakanta Pillai into a Hindu Nair family, at Nattalam in Kanyakumari district, which was part of the erstwhile Travancore kingdom.He was an official in the court of Travancore\\'s Maharaja Marthanda Varma when he was instructed into the Catholic faith by a Dutch naval commander.\"Lazarus\" or \"Devasahayam\" in Malayalam, translates to \"God is my help\".\"While preaching, he particularly insisted on the equality of all people, despite caste differences. This aroused the hatred of the higher classes, and he was arrested in 1749. After enduring increasing hardships, he received the crown of martyrdom when he was shot on 14 January 1752,\" a note prepared by the Vatican earlier had said.Sites linked with his life and death are in Kottar Diocese, in the Kanyakumari district of Tamil Nadu.Devasahayam was declared Blessed on December 2, 2012, in Kottar, 300 years after his birth.'}\n",

      "{'_id': ObjectId('659463de602e420d83ff44a1'), \"Book Review | Account of Nehru's vision well compiled, deficiently clarified\": 'This is a most apposite offering to the nation in the 75th year of its Independence. The \"debates\" that Jawaharlal Nehru had with Muhammad Iqbal, Mohammad Ali Jinnah and Syama Prasad Mookerjee defined the contours of Independent India; his debate with his deputy PM, Sardar Patel, over our China policy set the parameters of the continuing denigration of his foreign policy.Partisans (including reputed historians) tend to cherry-pick from these documents to reinforce the perspectives that they present; whereas Tripurdaman Singh and Adeel Hussain present the totality of the argument on both sides. But perhaps the most telling arguments are made by the authors themselves in their invaluable Introduction to the book and the preface they have provided to contextualise each of the four debates.In the Introduction, the author-compilers say Nehru’s vaulting vision was in practice tempered by the \"more mundane world of politics\" where \"contemporaries had to be disarmed, opponents confronted and outmanoeuvred, compromises struck, choices made, events responded to\", thus rendering some of Nehru’s arguments as debates with himself, between his soul and his mind, between the ideal and the practical. I regret though that Singh/Hussain have added \"Nehru’s own grip on power enhanced\" for that does not take into consideration the numerous times he offered to go. Nehru was not fighting for personal power but the power to shape India according to the vision he and his mentor, Mahatma Gandhi, had of the scaffolding of a composite India taking its place with a new morality of the world order on offer: an end to the \"Quest for Dominance\", as his grandson, Rajiv Gandhi, put it.With the poet-philosopher, Muhammad Iqbal, who famously described Nehru as a \"patriot\" and dismissed Jinnah as a \"politician\", Nehru shared a \"refined taste for Indian and Western philosophy and literature\", \"gifted orators\" both, ardent socialists both. Their debate revolved around religion and nation-building, a debate that continues to haunt our shared subcontinent decades after the two protagonists have ceased to be among us. While Iqbal \"made it clear that the policy of non-interference in religion is the only policy that can be adopted by the rulers of India\", the foundational principle he espoused was of \"Islamic solidarity\". To this, Nehru’s response was to point to fissures in thewider Muslim world to argue that \"nationalism and the solidarity of Islam do not fit in side by side. Each weakens the other\". He added in a later fusillade against the champions of religious orthodoxy of every persuasion, including of course Iqbal, that he was \"astonished\" that they \"ignore\" the problems of the wretchedly deprived to \"talk of vague metaphysical ideas and the good of the soul, shirk(ing) the problems of today in futile debate about yesterday\". Nehru continued that it further astonished him to find Iqbal advocating \"a social structure which may have suited a past age but is a hopeless anachronism today\". Iqbal hit back: Nehru, he alleged, \"inwardly resent(ed) the prospects of Muslim political and religious solidarity, particularly in India… I fear the articles reveal practically no acquaintance with Islam or its religious history\". And, so the argument continued, with neither losing an iota of his respect, indeed, affection for the other. I would have preferred to see this debate with Iqbal contextualised by Nehru’s arguments on the same points with Mookerjee, who headed the Hindu Mahasabha. But Singh/Hussian have preferred to cite Mookerjee’s objections to the First Amendment (that, ironically, is now being grossly misused by the very BJP that Mookerjee founded!)With Jinnah it was different, a no-holds barred political wrestling match. In the letters published here dating back to 1938, Nehru kept insisting that he was not prepared to discuss matters with Jinnah until Jinnah first set out the points of difference that he had with the Congress. Eventually, it was not Jinnah but Nehru who, based on material sent him by Jinnah, set out the 14 points to be reconciled, with the first being the League’s Fourteen Points. Nehru in 1938 was speaking from a position of strength, after the Congress trumped all others in the elections of 1937 and the Muslim League secured under five per cent of the Muslim vote in separate electorates. While Nehru stressed that without Independence in hand, it was futile to talk of constitutional protections which neither could do anything about at this pre-Independence stage, Jinnah refused to prioritise the struggle for Independence over safeguards for his minority. The proposed Nehru-Jinnah discussions never took place. By the time Independence became a contingency post-War Britain herself was pressing for, Jinnah had so rallied the Muslim vote (in highly restricted suffrage) that the positions of strength were reversed. I think Singh/Hussain would have served their purpose better if the speeches and writings of Jinnah and Nehru in 1945-48 had been retrieved as their argument in 1938 had become passe and déjà vu on the eve of Partition. Also, since Jinnah lived for 13 months in separated and independent Pakistan this reporting of their \"debate\" would have been enriched by including, in their own words, their post-Partition positions, contrasting, say, Nehru’s January 1948 address to AMU with Jinnah’s speech in the same month on the role of the sharia in Pakistan’s constitution.The major shortcoming in the book is that while this is, perhaps, the first time the general reader has been given access to Nehru’s Note for Cabinet on his China policy on November 18, 1950, effectively his rebuttal of the Sardar’s letter of November 7, 1950, the authors have joined the chorus of denunciation without answering the issues Nehru raised: what, in practical terms, could we have done differently? Sent our army into Tibet or captured the Chumbi Valley when Gen.Cariappa had said, \"Nothing doing\"? Imposed on China our interpretation of our northern frontiers? Militarily allied with the West in their crusade against communism just as India took the lead in breaking the West’s centuries-old hegemony? Fought a war with China in 1950 just as it was resisting, with telling effect, the might of the West in Korea? Could we have based ourselves in 1950 on war mongering when even in 1962 the communist Chinese unilaterally withdrew to where they had been before the outbreak of hostilities, not even remaining in Tawang? And the key question: why did the deutero-Nehru of post-1959 betray the proto-Nehru of 1949-59?'}\n",

The Consumer Prices Index, including owner occupiers\\' housing costs (CPIH), rose by 8.8 per cent in the 12 months upto September 2022. As per the November stats by the Office for National Statistics, the inflation rate sky-rocketed at 9.3 per cent.According to British High Commission\\'s statistics, India has now overtaken China as the largest nationality being issued sponsored study visas in the UK. Indians received the largest number of UK student visas at 1.27 lakh for the year ending in September 2022.\"I was forced to spend around Rs 1 lakh while shifting between Airbnbs between October 1 to October 21 last year and had over 10 in-person viewings for accommodation after arriving in London.

But with the constant financial crisis in the country I decided to go for a realistic approach by choosing a less inflated country as compared to the UK\".\"With a constant increase in prices, expectations and pressure increase too. As a student in a new country I would rather focus on my studies than to worry about how much allowance I am left with,\" he said.Rajeev has instead chosen to study Electronics Engineering from Canada after finishing school.Anubhav Seth, AVP, Career Launcher, however, feels that a massive shift in the popular choice of study abroad destinations is unlikely.\"The US, UK, Canada and Australia remain top destinations for students going abroad for higher education. Higher visa rejection rates for student applications to Canada and ease of applications for the UK have caused shifts among significant destinations, with UK emerging as the favourite. However, destinations such as UAE, Italy, Germany, Turkey, and Malaysia are quickly becoming hot destinations but a complete shift is unlikely,\" he said.His thoughts were echoed by Ankit Mehra, CEO and Co-founder of GyanDhan, an education financing company, who said the changes introduced by the UK Home Office for the Student visa do not directly impact Indian students\\' prospects of studying in the UK.\"The UK will not become less favourable anytime soon. The country is gaining traction owing to the implementation of the graduate route and the High Potential Individual visa route.\"But the rising cost of living has increased the financial burden on students abroad. It has led to a jump in the demand for top-up loans. Lenders have also increased the loan amount limit to pursue education abroad,\" Mehra said.Amit Singh, Founder of UniAcco, a global platform that helps students find the right accommodations, claimed that UK for the last 8-10 years has been going through a housing crisis, which has been putting pressure on the residential stock of real estate.\"In the last 4-5 years, the councils have come up very strongly against landlords leasing their accommodations to students.

But it's the medals that count\": 'The beast we know as social media needs to be continuously fed to keep it in perpetual outrage mode, and this week author Shobhaa De did the needful. Her tweet about the Indian contingent dismissed with a wave of the hand and a sneer their poor show at the Rio Olympics. De didn’t mince her words — all that the athletes would get back from Rio would be selfies, she suggested and called it a waste of money. Twitter warriors, always ready to take up cudgels from the comfort of their mobile phones, went after her and, naturally, since this was a made-for-television spat, channels went into overdrive to hold debates on this crucial issue. De being De, has not apologised for her tweet — and why should she — and neatly switched to criticising sports officials rather than the athletes. Two points arise out of this — first, as much as we have the right to criticise De for her views, she has a right to air them.Those who get worked up over things don’t always remember this. She may have been glib, she may have been unfair, but she has a right to say what she did. Her critics have a right to hit out at her, though in the typically crude style we have become used to, many of the attacks were ad hominem and downright nasty and obscene. But that, unfortunately, is the new normal and is not going to change any time soon. It is the second reaction that is more interesting, in that it provides a glimpse into what we have become. It is not as if in the pre-Twitter days people did not criticise Indian Olympians for failing to return with any medal. Not much was expected from the athletes, but certainly a poor show by the hockey team, which once dominated the world, evoked sharp comment from fans and the media.Conversely, every little achievement, even if it did not result in a medal, was seized upon for out of proportion glorification. Milkha Singh came fourth in the Rome Olympics and till today urban legend has it that if he hadn’t looked around he would have come third. P.T. Usha, a fine athlete with a slew of medals won at international races, made it to the finals in the 1984 Olympics but did not win. It was not till the Beijing Olympics that India won its first gold medal in an individual sport and that rightly turned Abhinav Bindra into a star. Others, such as Sushil Kumar, Mary Kom and Rajyavardhan Singh Rathore too have come back with medals. But while we hail their feat, it is sobering to know that Michael Phelps has now won 21 gold medals by himself! That is far more than the nine this country of 1.2 billion has won so far.Pointing this out is not being unpatriotic, but simply realistic. One of the criticisms against De was that she didn’t know and would never know the sheer hard work and effort that our Olympians had put in. And that is true — each of the sportspersons who have made it to the Olympics would have worked hard in the most trying of circumstances: poor infrastructure, unhelpful officials and simply an abundance of all the daily difficulties of life in India. Yet, of late, athlete after athlete has emerged from the far corners of this land and won the honour of representing their country in the greatest sports arena of this world. One cannot even begin to know the dedication of someone like Dipa Karmakar from Tripura to become the first-ever Indian gymnast to go to the Olympics. In a cricket-mad country, other sports get short shrift and gymnastics is almost non-existent, yet she, like her north-eastern compatriot Mary Kom, shrugged off the problems and practised hard to win that privilege.But while we laud the effort, it is a hard fact of life that the world does not recognise effort — it only hails achievement. Every athlete at the Olympics from every nation must have put in the same superhuman levels of practice to make it to Rio; they all carry the dreams of the countrymen and women. They all deserve to be hailed. But the record books will show the medal winners. If Indians lose \"by a whisker\", as Bindra did, that won’t be mentioned anywhere. Do we want to be known as a country that always fails by a whisker? Earlier in the week, a video showing Dipa Karmakar \"winning a gold medal\" was doing the rounds; it was obviously fake because the finals are on the 14th.Yet, many simply swallowed it as gospel, because not only are we hungry for good news, we now only want good news. We cannot face disappointment; our cricketers are the best, our athletes are the best and everything about us is the best. The media happily participates in building up this hyper-nationalistic narrative. De happened to be the person who said the bitter truth, so she had to be shouted down. I found the tweet a bit silly in tone (and premature too), but it wasn’t far off the mark. But she was expressing her anguish at the defeat after defeat of Indians and was angry to see the Indian hockey team lose to Germany while dominating the entire match. Yes, you guessed it, we lost by a whisker.'}\n",

In the four years, the BJP government has set up 49 more central government-owned companies.The increase in CPSEs runs counter to the widely prevalent perception of Prime Minister Narendra Modi being a believer in the concept of less government and more governance. \"Government has no business to be in business,\" Mr Modi said in October 2015, a few months after he took over power. However, the role of the government in business has only increased.Though the consistent disinvestment policy of successive governments has been to shed the management control of public sector units either by selling the companies to private sector entities or by bringing down the government stake to less than 50 per cent, the Modi government did not match the success of the Atal Behari Vajpayee government on this front.While the Vajpayee government managed to bring down the government stake to less than 50 per cent in many companies, data available on BSE indicates that the Modi government has been following the cautious approach adopted by the Left-leaning UPA governments by selling stake in single-digit percentages.The Centre has raised Rs 1,36,018 crore from 2014 to 2019 by selling minority stakes in 41 public sector companies, which include Navratna PSUs as well as others. But it did not sell any PSU to a private company. From 1998 to 2004, the Vajpayee government had sold 14 CPSEs and 19 hotels to private entities.The BSE data also shows that the big-ticket stake sale under the Modi government has been to exchange traded funds. While a CPSE buying another CPSE amounts to the transfer of cash from one hand to another, ETFs do not involve ending inefficient government-led management systems at CPSEs—both of which paint the current policy preference as status quoist.The Modi government raised Rs 82,448 crore from Bharat 22 ETFs and CPSE ETFs from 2014 to November 2019. It also raised Rs 52,829 crore by way of imperfect disinvestment of selling the government’s stake in a CPSE to another CPSE.The government has also raised Rs 18,300 crore by selling partial stake that erstwhile UTI had in some blue-chip companies.In July this year, however, Minister of State for Finance Anurag Thakur informed the Lok Sabha that the government has given an in-principle nod for the strategic disinvestment of 23 CPSEs.'}\n",
      "{'_id': ObjectId('65951b0cb985d57965ff1880'), 'Hypocrisies of caste: A timely reminder to Indians': 'It is not clear who the intended reader of Dr Gwendolyn Simpson Chabrier’s 267-page book India’s Untouchables may be. Dr Chabrier has taught literature at universities in New York and Paris and has written about William Faulkner and Norman Mailer in the past. She has also authored a novel about Myanmar called Asian Destiny and another novel, Behind the Barbed Wire, about the Holocaust.Bookshelves groan under the weight of books written about the horrors of the Holocaust. They may soon start groaning under the weight of books written about India by anyone who has had any connection with this country and some who have just had access to libraries and secondary material.The author has clearly spent an enormous of time reading about India’s caste system. The bibliography runs into almost 15 pages. This is in addition to the notes and references at the end of each of the six chapters.For many Indians, much of what Dr Chabrier says would be familiar. Caste remains one of those subjects that the argumentative Indian can argue endlessly about. In Narendra Modi’s India, we are told caste is becoming less relevant and subsumed to development with a Hindutva packaging. But Uttar Pradesh’s new chief minister and Bharatiya Janata Party’s stormy petrel Yogi Adityanath is on record saying that while he does not believe in casteism, he does not see anything wrong with caste being the organising principle of society. This essentially boils down to saying that everyone should know his/her place. That is the central message of caste. Those who stand to lose with this organising principle are those at the bottom of the hierarchy and who face the brunt of oppression by those above.Dr Chabrier catalogues a lot of the information that is available about various aspects of caste — the pernicious system, it origins, etc., the social reformers and politicians in India who tried to turn this system upside down, the untouchable men, the untouchable women, the untouchable children and finally untouchables and Indian literature.Given the way the information is presented, the book does come across as one about caste as seen through a Western lens. It provides a lot of information to non-Indian readers who may know little about the subject and can be used as a rapid reader by Indians who know something about the subject but would like to go deeper.India’s Untouchables By Gwendolyn Simpson Chabrier Grove Press, pp. 272, Rs 1,088I found the chapter on \"The Untouchable Women\" one of the more interesting parts of the book. Dr Chabrier’s style is text-bookish, but there are sections in which India’s Untouchables comes alive as in the segment about Manu Smriti and women. She lists the various ways in which women were sought to be debased while they were struggling to regain the respect and equality they used to have in the early Vedic era.While pointing out that the untouchable and Sudra women were the most vulnerable, \"as they were positioned at the lowest level of the social, economic and religious ladder,\" the\\xa0 author rightly draws attention to the fact that prior to the time of Manu, not only were women in this country free to choose their husbands or to remarry if widowed, they also held positions of high respect in the intellectual and social spheres. The chapter talks about the various phases of India’s feminist movement and situates the formation of the National Federation of Dalit Women in 1995 in that context. There are references to other Dalit women’s organisations too.One sentence that leapt out in this chapter is a quote from a woman activist who observes, \"No one practises untouchability when it comes to sex,\" underlining the corrosive hypocrisy of the caste-based order.In her conclusion, the author makes a point worth recognising. \"Since the 1991 economic reforms were implemented, India has become an international player. Despite the country’s poverty, the Indian economy has furthermore demonstrated a steady growth. Yet once again, caste has still remained a hindrance for India in reaching its full economic potential. This is the result of India’s fundamental belief in inequality.\"Many Indians that I know would froth and fume reading that. Caste may not be a big factor in the lives of many people we know and mix with in metropolitan India. But despite all the laws and rhetoric, it remains a dark, unimaginably grim reality in huge swathes of the country. We know much of what Dr Chabrier tells us. Till we collectively reject caste as an organising principle of the social order, the slogan of Sabka Saath Sabka Vikas can’t become a reality for millions.'}\n",

He opened it in 2019, but was forced to shut it down during Covid. The museum was recently reopened to the public, after the addition of several important memorabilia.Messner’s father was an artist from Vienna and he made his first trip to Bangkok, to cast bronze images for the family business. But his life changed, when he bumped into \"the last, real godfather of Bangkok\", who introduced him to many parts of Bangkok, including the Patpong nightlife district. Before he knew it, Messner had opened his first bar there, and in time, as many as 10 bars. His interaction with numerous people in Patpong, including international visitors, introduced him to the incredible history of Bangkok’s famed sex life district.A tour of the unique Patpong Museum, said, and showed it all.As Messner said, \"It’s a one-hour educational, cultural, edutainment tour of Bangkok’s most iconic area, which incorporates 100 years of world history.\"One learnt that the story of Patpong started when a Chinese trader Tun Phu from Hainan migrated to Thailand more than 100 years back, and changed his name to Pun Phat. He became a very well established businessman, and was bestowed the title of \"Luang Patpongpanich\" by the Thai King. His son Udom went to the London School of Economics for his education. But when World War-II started, he moved to the US, and became part of the CIA training programmes.This was where he encountered Jim Thompson, the famed American who moved to Bangkok, and started the Jim Thompson silk empire.When he returned to Thailand, the Patpongpanich family bought a banana plantation at the edge of Bangkok, with a teak villa. They built many shop houses there, and Udom soon convinced well-known corporate, financial, travel companies, and even media houses, to set up offices there — everyone, from IBM to Caltex to Air France. It aimed to become the Wall Street of the city, and set up a modern power plant, cable lines, air-condition connections.But it also became an undercover centre for CIA Operations, and the drugs trade.It was after the Vietnam War, when the American soldiers filtered into Thailand, that the go-go bars and lounges opened. Sex, drugs, and rock and roll soon became the theme of the well-known bars which included the Grand Prix Lounge, and the Mississippi Queen, that were visited by many celebrities, including Bob Hope, Don King. William Dafoe. It was also visited by various infamous personalities, which included the notorious killer Charles Sobhraj. He lived in Patpong from 1975-76, and visited the bar often with his girlfriend, and even some of his victims. The clippings of his first killings in the city, reported by Bangkok Post newspaper, are all on display in Patpong Museum. In fact, a lot of the memorabilia in Patpong Museum came from the Bangkok Post Archives, including rare photographs, posters, videos.Some of the well-known go-go bars, like the Black Pagoda, Madrid Bar, and so on, are re-created in the Patpong Museum. Many films were shot here, and excerpts from the films are on display, including the Oscar winning films Deer Hunters, Apocalypse Now, and others. The well-known character Colonel Kurtz, from the latter film, was based on a real-life character Tony Poe from Patpong, whose life story is enumerated in the museum.The House of Fame video section, exhibits the many celebrities who visited Patpong — Jean Claude Van Damme, David Bowie, whose song \"Ricochet\" was shot here, and many others.The go-go section in the museum has pictures and videos of the infamous go-go acts and shows of Patpong. There is even a fun ping-pong game, based on Patpong’s most notorious sex show.That’s why the age bar for the museum is 18 years. There is a Lady Boy section, referring to the many transgenders in the sex business.A unique addition is a gallery section, with portraits of the sex workers, by a top Thai artist. Some of the paintings were sold recently, and the money went towards an educational fund for the sex workers.It’s a fascinating and riveting study of the incredible world history of Thailand’s infamous nightlife districtThe Patpong Museum has already won the Museum Thailand Award, as \"the best local and community museum\". It has also won the Trip Advisor’s Award, as a \"top 10 per cent\" attraction worldwide. Messner and his son Tennessee are proud of the museum, which has tours every half-hour. They hope to welcome Indian tourists soon.For more details, check www.patpongmuseum.com.'}\n",

The crisis is caused in part by a lack of foreign currency, which has meant that the country cannot afford to pay for imports of staple foods and fuel, leading to acute shortages and very high prices.Meanwhile, Sri Lankan President Mahinda Rajapaksa, Gotabaya Rajapaksa on Monday admitted that mistakes like banning chemical fertilisers in 2020 and not seeking an IMF bailout led to the current economic crisis.President Rajapaksa, younger brother of Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa, also said his government should have opted to go for an International Monetary Fund (IMF) bailout much earlier. It was a mistake not to go.Speaking to his newly inducted Cabinet Ministers, the president termed his decision to ban chemical fertilisers in farming \"a mistake\" and that corrective steps were being taken now.President Rajapaksa on Monday appointed a new 17-member Cabinet that excluded his close relatives except for Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa, as he called for a \"system change\" amidst growing demand for his resignation over the worst economic crisis faced by the island nation.President Rajapaksa in mid-2020 banned the use of fertiliser imports in order to turn to a green agricultural policy with organic fertiliser.Agriculturists had protested the move, saying there would be a food shortage due to crop loss/loss in field output. Notwithstanding, the government had gone ahead with the move and followed it up with a crackdown on shopkeepers and traders following reports of hoarding of staple food items.Commenting on the ongoing public protests, President Rajapaksa said, I can understand the anger of the people, they have to put up with the high cost of living while suffering in the queues to buy essentials.\"The government resisted calls from economists to resort to a bailout from the IMF in view of dwindling foreign reserves.A government delegation is currently in Washington negotiating with the IMF after it announced last week, the island\\'s first-ever international debt default.Largely attended public protests including the one opposite his secretariat here and a cross-country call for President Rajapaksa\\'s resignation has jolted the government.The stock exchange has also been suspended for a week with effect from Monday.The state power entity said there will be four and a half-hour power cuts on Monday.Sri Lanka\\'s state oil entity has raised its retail price from Monday midnight, the second in a month.

Zinta later clarified that she had not initiated but only supported the move to remove the alleged offender, declaring that as the child of an Army man who had fought for his country, she couldn’t countenance this act of defiance. (The law does not insist on every person standing, but she may not have known that.)She also claimed that while some twitterati had criticised her for being over-enthusiastic and a busybody, she had received a lot of support from fellow patriots. She must be right because now comes the news of another cinemagoer who got roughed up for the same \"offence\"; her protestations that she was a South African did not cut much ice with the mob — when in India you better be an Indian patriot.Patriotism is in the air and one now no longer must be a patriot but also demonstrate it publicly in every way possible. The optics of proclaiming one’s patriotism are very important — simply painting a national flag on one’s cheek for a cricket match will not do. Besides, it is also imperative to ensure that the general \"patriotism quotient\" in society is maintained at a high level; those who bring down the average have no place in India. That invites the riposte — \"what, you don’t like this about your country? Why don’t you go to Pakistan?\" Except that \"country\" easily gets conflated with ideology, religion and individuals, who may be seen to represent patriotism more than others. For those who need further clarification, a few days on Twitter will be very educative.Nor is patriotism the prerogative of those who live in India. In fact, the further you are from India the more patriotic you become. Indians living in the country at least are given the allowance to crib about quality of life — potholes, traffic jams, corruption. From the safe distance of America or Australia, India acquires an amber glow and thus must be loved and worshipped. The patriotism of those who left India many years ago — presumably because they were so patriotic that they couldn’t stand it — is boundless. We can learn a thing or two from them.Now, this patriotism, like all commodities, is being monetised too. Marketers and advertisers routinely now wave the flag to promote their products and the irony that a soft-drink, mobile phone or car made by a multi-national is being sold with the help of the Tricolour seems to escape all of us. Or if we notice it, we don’t seem to care. Perhaps drinking as many colas as we can is our patriotic duty after all.Mumbai’s filmmakers too have cannily sussed out that there are commercial possibilities in packaging and selling it to the punters. Whether it is a film on Mary Kom, which ends with a rousing rendition of the national anthem or even Haider, which thanks the Army for its role in the rescue operations during the floods, filmmakers are leaving nothing to chance. The irony is that Haider, a far more truthful film than many others, which has been attacked for showing the Army rounding up Kashmiris and torturing them, had to tag that at the end. Was that an attempt by Vishal Bharadwaj to buy some insurance from ultra-patriots who may go after him or just a straightforward way of redressing the balance? And what would he have done had there been no floods? The bigger question is — is it a filmmaker’s (or novelist’s or artist’s) job to wave the patriotic flag or should he tell a story as honestly as he can?Mumbai’s film industry has always been sharp and quickly incorporates the prevailing national mood in its films. Whether it is the Angry Young Man of the 1970s or the post-liberalisation consumerism-cum-conservatism of the 1990s and beyond, \"Bollywood\" has shown a fine understanding of what India is thinking and how best it can be woven into their next film so that it scores a hit with the audiences. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn’t. But patriotism is a staple, which can be trotted out at any time. Rare is the filmmaker who questions national narratives or approaches them with nuance — Chetan Anand’s Haqeeqat was no less patriotic than say Manoj Kumar’s various outings about Bharat, but whereas the latter was in your face, Anand stayed away from propaganda. Today, anything less than a glowing account will not do — there are enough people who would declare that their sentiments had been hurt and before you know it, you will be fighting PILs in every corner of the country. That is if the government hasn’t stepped in by then and banned your film.So, one might well ask, what is wrong with all this? Patriotism is a good thing, isn’t it? Shouldn’t one love one’s country? These questions are valid, but only up to a point. The issue here is not patriotism per say, but unbridled and unquestioning uber-nationalism that allows no room for dissent of any kind. Rah-rah patriotism, one that demands that everyone wears it on their sleeves all the time and terms anyone who has legitimate apprehensions about the nation as \"unpatriotic\" is dangerous. History offers us many instances — Nazi Germany is just one — of the ill-effects of hyper-patriotism. Frenzied flag-waving that drowns out any and every contrarian voice can only lead to an intolerant society, which in a multi-religious, multi-cultural nation such as ours will invariably result in serious turbulence. There is much in India to be patriotic about — our remarkable unity despite so much diversity is just one of them — but equally there are concerns that must be expressed. Most of all, every Indian must be allowed to have a point of view, even if it goes against the consensus. Throwing people out of the theatre is not the way to deal with it.'}\n",

The VDAs will include prevailing cryptocurrencies and non-fungible tokens (NFTs).The bill also outlaws publishing of transaction-level information submitted by businesses to the customs department to prevent such information from being utilised by international entities and hostile countries to the detriment of Indian firms.Replying to a discussion on the Finance Bill, Sitharaman said India was probably the only country that did not resort to new taxes to fund the recovery of the economy hit by the pandemic.\\xa0 \"According to an OECD report, as many as 32 countries have increased the tax rates after the pandemic,\" she said, adding \"Instead, we put more money where multiplier effect would be maximum,\" she said while referring to the budget\\'s focus on raising capital expenditure.\"The Budget 2022-23 raised capital expenditure by 35.4 per cent to Rs 7.5 lakh crore.'}\n",
